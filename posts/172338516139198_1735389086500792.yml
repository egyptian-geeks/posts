  Hello,

  I want to start a discussion about which front-end framework would you recommend for a beginner to learn in 2018 ? and what would be your criteria for choosing this specific framework?
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  here is what I think of the current big 3 [Angular, React, vue]. I haven't used any of them for an extended amount of time other than react. so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

  My main criteria for judging is : relevancy in the job market, learning curve, development speed and advocating good development practices.

  - Angular: I don't think angular 1 is relevant anymore. for angular2 though I think it's accessible and relevant enough. but I fear typescript maybe not a intuitive to those who are just starting to learn JavaScript. also last time I used it there seems to be always trouble finding packages that have typescript typing. also RxJS is not that intuitive. However I haven't used angular2 for over a year now so maybe that has changed.

  - React: while I think react is one the most relevant and well designed framework/rendering Library. it doesn't come free of cost though since it's learning curve is not negligible. and JSX and Redux look very intimidating at first. I think it deserves extra points though for advocating good practices like unidirectional data flow and functional programming. but it loses these points due to the fact that it's ecosystem is so vast. that any beginners will get decision fatigue really quickly thus leading to slow development speed.

  - Vue: I have only used vue recently so my opinion is not rock solid. but so far it seems to try to find the sweet spot between development speed and good development practices. it does most of the stuff that react almost in a similar way but with less boilerplate. also it has a nice mature ecosystem with easy integrations. for example vue-router is stupidly easy to integrate. however I still doubt it's capabilities in bigger projects and I am not a fan of it's templating engine or it how uses strings to reference stuff around [too much magic for me]. it still seems like a really good option to start with.

  So TL;DR for me I think Vue is the best to start with for beginners.

      and limited by the framework. \nmaybe it's a fast way, but who will develop
      other framework and from where can build the imagination and creativity.\nYes,
      I agree its good with companies and business but not for learning.\nif you mean
      after learning the basics and that's for not start its okay"

    message: 'For me at the very least I think they need to cover the background before
      that, meaning they need to know JavaScript''s async nature, you don''t know
      JavaScript book series or pluralsight''s course deep JavaScript foundations,
      and a little ES6 wouldn''t hurt, maybe the net ninja YouTube playlist on that,
      after that maybe build processes, whether task runners or module bundlers, I
      think for the modern JavaScript developer what is needed is to get caught up
      not left out, a great book that might help is JavaScript application design:
      a build first approach where the writer gets at the core of what is to be known
      conceptually from build processes, testing, MVC architecture, and so on'

      have you ever had a look on Backbone JS
      it was the only framework I had used in a real world project, i really liked it.
      it is so simple, Backbone offers simple MVVM pattern, but no out of the box templating engine, binding or dependency injection, you are free to choose any library to achieve complete the missing blocks, or even write your own.
      it really fills the gab between just following the framework and have good understanding of what going under the hoods
