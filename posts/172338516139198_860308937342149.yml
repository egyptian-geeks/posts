      This trick is used in most big websites. lets say e-commerce.

      You save your product in mysql the data get exported to either memcached, Elasticsearch or Solr and you get your data directly from them. You will also find the need to expire keys maybe by using any good MQ systems and running a full import in case of something wrong or running a migration.
