      1. Learn the languages well, not the frameworks (HTML, CSS & JavaScript "not jQuery") all in depth. Frameworks come & go if you know the languages you can pick any framework in a couple of days.

      2. This depends on the problem you want to solve, you shouldn't pick up a framework or a tool before understanding what is the problem you are trying to solve. But if you want to play with some frameworks, I recommend looking into React & Vue

      - https://facebook.github.io/react/
      - https://vuejs.org/

      3. MDN is the best reference for JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

      4. This is one of the best channels (it's about JavaScript & programming in general) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q

      Also a couple of free books:
      - http://eloquentjavascript.net/
      - (6 books) https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

      You can check here for projects that are looking for help especially for first-time contributors https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners or check for label "first-timers-only" on issues https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Afirst-timers-only+is%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=searchresults
