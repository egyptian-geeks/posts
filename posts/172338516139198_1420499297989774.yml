      You're definitely not the only one experiencing this, I've seen other, very good engineers, getting a similar experience.

      Of course, the way the CV is written and your linkedin profile are possible reasons, so ask relevant people about their opinions and tune it, re-iterate as much as you can on them, just to get an interview/technical test, after that it should be up to your actual skills.

      It's never easy to tell the reason, but other possible reasons:
      - "Europe" is very broad, depending on the countries you applied to, some may prefer candidates with some knowledge of native language (e.g. German for German companies)
      - Some may not be willing to "sponsor" visa for candidates from non-EU countries
      - Some may be willing to sponsor but only for special positions or positions where they have mass shortage
      - Some may be in a hurry for that specific position and visa process from some countries like Egypt, India, Pakistan, Jordan, etc.. i known to take several months.
      - Some may be expecting a position-specific / tailor-made cover letter for joining them and not something generic so your CV was automatically filtered out.

      Advice:
      No need to apply "in bulk" to a couple of hundred companies, in most cases that doesn't really help. Carefully choose a few companies that you know well and aware that they are sponsoring international candidates and have no language requirements and focus on those. Carefully write a specific cover letter for each one. Look for someone to refer you or even search for a recruiter on linkedin and ping them. Of course do that after working on your CV and linkedin profile and Rabena yewfa2 ;)
