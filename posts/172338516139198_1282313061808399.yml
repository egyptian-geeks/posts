  - description: I have over a year of experience in software development (mainly
      Python) and I don’t think I’ve seen a job posting for a software engineer that
      doesn’t require solving a coding problem that doesn’t involve CS topics (specifically
      algorithms and data structures). Do I have to learn these topics?
