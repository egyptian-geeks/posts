      Hi Mohamed , I thought that in the past 'Wordpress is an idiot to serialize the array of the theme settings' , but i found that Wordpress only serialize it's own data , and it can unserialize it again without distribute you .

      Serialization if a feature , in some cases you yourself should use it to get benefit from translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored .

      Let's say you have some post data, but your database can't be modified to store the new post data in separate fields.

      You could serialize your $_POST array and store it in the persistent storage.  I've found the necessity of storing the POST as a "payload" of sorts quite invaluable at times.

      Knowing you can do something, doesn't mean you have to use it everywhere.

      Wordpress serializes its own data because it didn't yet understand the meaning of a relational database! Check the wp_options table for instance!

      They also are very stupid to rely on database for config variables that are proven to be better stored in config files.

      In other systems (CMSes or not) it is perfectly easy to fix this using a one liner .htaccess rule, but in Wordpress you have to SUFFER!

      This is the MOST STUPID design I have ever seen! Also to change the site url, you need to change TWO different records in the wp_options table!

      Just check the docs :
