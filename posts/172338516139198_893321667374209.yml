      know that people here would respect a person working at a foriegn company more

      Open Source is not the opposite of Intellectual Property, that's completely wrong, Open Source is part of the Intellectual Property system, that's why you need to honor Open Source licenses.
      What I am trying to say here, in Egypt Companies is not the problem, at least "controlling" the companies won't make any difference without having a comprehensive solution for all other problems.

      it, you must teach others. Egyptian companies are definitley the problem, and
      in the capitalist system, it is a dynamic of supply and demand and also a union.
      So If we as geeks team up, we could be a strong sudo union.  Actually,, Egyptian
      companies abuse the employees and they actually have secret meetings to set
      our salaries. The idea of intellectual property and patents is absolutely pathetic
      in my eyes, but that is my opinion and my school of thought.

    message: That's a bigger philosophical discussion, you can have whatever system
      you want, you just need to prove it works, medical companies which invest billions
      in R&D of a drug on the course of decades need some sort of protection to make
      sure they make profit, at the end of the day that's why a company exists, that's
      how capitalism works, again it is a flawed system however it works, you can
      design a different system where some entity with no profit intentions owns the
      R&D for example and provides it for free or a reasonable price that covers costs,
      that's ok too, it is just not capitalism.

      old fashioned way of doing things before these pathetic patent laws. Anyways,
      back to the point, if we band together and make rules we can change the way
      thngs are done. That is what I was aiming for in the first place. So whyt not
      make rules for teh job group so no one posts a job for 1000 LE and 7 days a
      week with ability to work under pressure?  That;'s why I support teh readify
      post, make them fight for resources, so they either take meduim level people
      and invest in them or appreciate the top people they have

      It is hard to argue against patent system (generally) because it has been around for hundreds of years, and it served us well in terms of engineering and general industry advances, you can argue against it in Software may be, but still until a viable alternative that fills this need exists you can't just throw it away.
      As for regulating jobs, work conditions, wages, working hours ... etc, you can always do this via Unions and Syndicates that speak on behalf of the developers community and push for regulations.

      to speak on your behalf in these cases, when a major layoff happens, it makes
      sure its members get compensated otherwise it will either sue the company, or
      give it a worse rank which will affect this company's ability to acquire more
      business and\or hire more people in the future, this is a problem that has been
      in the world for many decades with many solutions with varying degrees of success.
