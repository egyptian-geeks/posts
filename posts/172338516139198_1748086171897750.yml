message: "My passion for web development began a year ago\nI've learned for a long
  time basics for Front End (js - html - css boostrap -  jquery )\n \nThese basics
  were used in making some Templets, by convert psd to html that was downloaded from
  the Internet.\n\nThen some friends advised me to start learning (React and angular)\nBut
  I have difficulty in understanding why I do not know why and then I stopped\n\nHere
  I am now suspended 4 months ago and I would like to go back to learning until I
  get a good job .. What are your advice What do I do? \n\nthanks"

    message: Looks like u are a strong front end person.. why don't you play your
      strengths and focus on that learn more about user interaction design and UX
      and drop all those back end plans all together

    message: I am not front end so may be my advice is not relevant. . But anyway
      .. i think you gave up angular n react quickly because you thought they will
      be easy to learn as the previous technologies you mentioned .. but  you judged
      yourself quickly as not able to understand. . My advice is to try again specially
      with angular. . It has good future  (as far as i know) just give yourself enough
      time to learn it.. good luck:)

    message: both Angular and React are hard to grasp quickly, u have to spend quite
      time to understand what's going on, although Angular require too much knowledge
      before you can start using it, React has simple APIs that let you start quicker
      but still it's okay if u don't get it quick. both frameworks do the same job
      so you only need to Learn one, I would vote for React

    message: You need to learn Javascript well first. The good parts og JavaScript
      is a good book. Then learn typescript. Then try to learn simple mvc implmentation
      like knockout.

    message: Basics of js, html, css, jq not enough to understand react and angular
      concepts, you have to go deeper into js core concepts will be good if you know
      about es6, modular js, oop concepts, mvc... , then you will understand react
      and angular easily.
