  wondered how the app generating a valid codes even my mobile is not connected to
  the internet ?\ni'm just guessing that the app is getting a list of valid codes
  the first time you authenticate your account with it and keep changing them randomly
  and when you are connected it sync with the service to update the used codes with
  new ones. is that true ???\n\nPST : i'm referring to this app exactly : \n"

      I don't know the exact technical details but I think this is how it works:
      The server generates a random seed and puts it in a QR code, your phone acquires this seed, then your phone keeps concatenating the seed with the current UTC time and applies some sort of hashing function on it, then the result is shown on your phone screen in a numerical form (and probably trimmed), when the server asks you for the number and you enter it, it does the same operation on its side to verify.
      I noticed that the codes change every 30 seconds, so it probably doesn't take the exact current time in UTC, but probably the last 30-seconds mark.
      The part I'm not sure of is how the hashing is done (might be hash both then concatenate then hash, instead of concatenate then hash, or something much more complicated), but I'm sure that it the algorithm depends on a seed value and the current time, that's how it doesn't require an internet connection :)
