  claiming harassment.  :S"

    message: It is a legal battle you talk about with a subjective Judge. The fact
      remains, this is a man stating objective scientific studies, and Google basically
      "outlawyered"  him :D you say "He had no case for discrimination. His opinions
      about gender are not even protected by discrimination laws in the work place."
      as if that somehow trumps his reasoning, or logic or even the fact that he was
      in fact discriminated against for having an opinion
