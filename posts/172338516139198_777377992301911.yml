    message: "Not bad on an overall scale but the controls are super hard. Having
      to keep the mobile leveled at a 90° angle, very uncomfortable. \n\nNonetheless,
      the sensitivity is much better than your previous game so that's progress right
      there.\n\nThe menu and HUD need a lot of work, there should also be some way
      to turn off the music/sound volume.\nWhen I started playing and wanted to leave,
      the back button didn't do much, I eventually had to pause and click Main Menu.\n\nFinally,
      you probably played beach head before, beach head got boring pretty quickly
      but was still fun to play because they did a fantastic job at keeping the game
      intense and its difficultly escalated pretty quickly.\n\nThey also constrainted
      the view angle so you only had a limited FOV to worry about, I think your best
      bet with this game being unique enough is ditching the open landscape. \n\nImagine
      the player garrisoned in a building that's about to fall apart, the players
      job is to secure the building from multiple fixed points, say two or three windows
      that overlook a couple of street corners in a town being overrun by Germans,
      Aliens or god knows what,  zombies work too :D\nThis gives you a controlled
      environment, with little art work to worry about and much more exciting game
      play mechanics\n\nNot to mention the plot would make much more sense.\n\nBeach
      head took the shooter genre to a whole new level and a couple of others as well,
      they pioneered the mechanics but failed on the overall scenery challenge, plot
      and mechanics variety.\n\nGood luck."
