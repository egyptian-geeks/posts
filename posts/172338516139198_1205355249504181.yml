    message: DevOps is not about specific tools, It's about cooperating between developers
      and operation team to streamline the software delivery process. in other words,
      doing the job of operations through the perspective of a developer. So you can
      assure that your SW is delivered correctly/efficiently and works similarly between
      different environments (dev/staging/production) as much as possible. This part
      is important to implement continuous delivery and continuous Integration (CD/CI).
      DevOps contains different goals that was(and still) performed by operations
      team like high availability(HA) so you can assure that your setup can survive
      if some of your infrastructure gone off, or you can scale up(automatically if
      possible) to handle the load of new visitors. Another goal is automation, so
      you can automate repeated tasks like provisioning new servers and updating you
      infrastructure setup(tools like Ansible/Chef). Another tools is monitoring,
      so you can see the state of your servers and apps ( tools like ELK stack or
      any kind of Daemon that can collect data/logs and save them for monitoring).  What
      I mean is DevOps is not about tools, It's about goals that you want to implement
      and you learn the tools along the way.
