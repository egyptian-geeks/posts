      I did it first to mitigate the IT Helpdesk guys :D

      If you are in an organisation that uses Active Directory, YES!

    message: "Here is what WScript.exe does:\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh875526(v=ws.11).aspx\n\nHere
      is what CScript.exe does:\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490816.aspx\n\nHere's
      the difference between them. If you want to close one you may want to close
      the other: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8678441/difference-between-wscript-and-cscript\n\nNow
      to answer your question:\n-If you're just a home user who mainly browses the
      internet, you maybe able to get away with removing them (though I would suggest
      just renaming them) and not regretting it. \n-If you are anything more, be very
      careful. VB scripts are used to automate configuration tasks in Windows, not
      just by IT admins. Setup scripts for software development tools or things you
      want to configure may be written in VBS. \n\nDeleting WScript or SCript to prevent
      virus infections is like deleting powershell to prevent the same issue... You're
      stripping away a core system component that is used by many applications in
      hope that it closes a surface of attack.\n\nFrom a security perspective, what
      you are suggesting actually makes the most sense on servers where you absolutely
      control the image and what it can do. This is why Azure (and other cloud computing
      providers) will give you server images that are stripped down of most things
      that come with the OS to keep it slim and reduce unnecessary churn on the processors
      as well as security surface attack area.\n\nBut for a home PC, deleting WScript
      is like turning down the Air Conditioner because it's cold when the front door
      is wide open. It is nothing compared to keeping the browser in the OS. :) The
      end user will happily click yes to things that are so much worse than a VB script."
