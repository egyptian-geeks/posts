    message: Yup, check angular, ember, react, and brothers. Another thing, "separation
      of concern" is a case-by-case thing. Doing the above side by side my business
      logic is a personal decision, I could do it and live with the maintenance hell
      I put my self in. Or I could separate business logic and my UI logic as much
      as I can and have a little bit better maintenance burden.

      The web app of today should work on different devices, with different screen sizes. An internet connection is not always available, so your app should be able to work offline. The data flow is not a client request & server response model. The server can push updates to your app. You also want to implement all of this efficiently.

      You need to apply the ViewModel pattern to the UI, and with it you need controllers (to handle different UI events), repository pattern (to abstract the difference between backend service & local storage), concurrency control, caching, performance.

      Think of Facebook, Gmail, Google maps, etc. Even if you're working on an inventory system, if you know you've 100K materials, you will use auto-complete from the start, not a drop down.

      It has been sometime since I used jQuery like this. The last time I wrote it, it was for a static website. See, jQuery is the shell script of the web. You can't create Gmail with jQuery, or shell scripts.

    message: Mohammad Tayseer the idea is you can use controls like Telerik to do
      stuff like that and they handle all that behaviour for you, there is no reason
      a developer with  a valuable brain should be wasting his valuable time doing
      presentation layer stuff, unless you are making a game maybe. As for offline
      versions on an inventory system, you would use a windows application or even
      GTK for that, not a web application for sure. In ERP systems it is important
      to take advantage of client processing power and a 3-tier approach makes a lot
      of sense.  As for MVC, I really see no need to use that unless you like the
      pattern or there is a specific need that warrants its use, which is pretty rare.
      In terms of GMAIL, Google maps and FB, they are just that, no one wants there
      ERP experience to be anything like that and it is never worth the time or investment
      or even considered an enhancement, they would rather have more fine grained
      control over the financial tree.  Amazingly, most simple websites don't really
      require all the complexity you talk about.  :)

    message: Mohammad Tayseer with ease of deployment these days, in a corp environement
      that is no longer a problem and on the web as well, maybe I am old fashioned,
      but instead of having manyapplications open now we have many browser tabs. In
      the end, he number of apps I really use were never that big. I use and IDE,
      a browser and rarelly office like applications. I never use smartphone apps
      and have never found a really useful one that has me glued to my smarphone,
      maybe and IDE ? :) Other than that, I could use Web apps like office on the
      web when I rarely need to edit documnets, then it is mostly evernote.
