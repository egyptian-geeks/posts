message: Thanwya amma graduate here, will be attending Ain Shams University (hopefully),
  I'd like your opinion on website/s from which I could self study programming languages,
  there's corsera, khan academy, coder and code. If there are better ones, kindly
  drop them in a comment down below. Also I'd like to ask if we're taking c++ in the
  first semester (for example) should I pre-study c++ or go for another programming
  language instead? Thanks in advance!

    message: "Hi, I'm a student at Ain Shams University, Faculty of Engineering. I
      will major in Computer Engineering. In your first year, you will study 'Computer
      Technology' in the first semester, it will include a portion about the C programming
      language. I suggest you learn JavaScript of any other 'scripting language' first
      as they will not be very intimidating to learn. You can find a very good JavaScript
      interactive course at Codecademy.com. If you have the time, learn HTML, CSS
      & JavaScript all together (all from Codecademy). \nIf you want to learn C/C++,
      I suggest learning C from the book written by the founders of C, it is called
      'The C Programming Language' by K&R. for C++ I suggest waiting till you grasp
      C first at college then proceed to learn it. \nGood Luck!"

      you don't get distracted.

    message: I'll actually be attending as a CS student not a computer engineer but
      we're on the same page since we're talking about programming, i'll be taking
      a java course starting next week, i was wondering if i should take JS or C along
      with java or just focus on it for the time being, what do you suggest?

    message: "If you are going to start with Java in college, don't learn C/C++ now,
      it will just confuse you at first and we don't want that to happen. \nTry Codecademy
      and JavaScript first to get to learn what is a programming language and how
      to use it. Beware, Java and JavaScript are completely different in functionality
      (Java is not JavaScript and vice versa). \nWhen you proceed with your Java course
      at college, you can then start to learn C/C++, they share a quite large amount
      of similarities.\nThe most important thing to know is that you DON'T have to
      know every little detail about a programming language in order to master it.
      Actually caring about those small details might be overwhelming and prevent
      you from mastering it. Eventually, you will know about them, just do not rush
      things or try to learn everything at once."

      If there's anything that has helped me dive deep in CS it was CS50, take that course for god's sake it will help you on the long run.
      Also the instructor is an absolute genius and the problem sets are fun.

      If you'd take my opinion I'd advise you to delay learning Java until you have a better grip on programming.
      Java is Object Oriented
      While C is Procedural
      Procedural is simpler to start with.
      But if you have to start Java then it's okay you can do both in parallel
