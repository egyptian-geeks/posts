  For those who don't know that #EMACS is the greatest and most extensible piece of software ever written.

  Some say:

  Linux is the software library that allowa EMACS to talk to the hardware :)

      and nah, I am not smart enough. Instead, I prefer my software to have default settings that are not a health hazard.
      I need to say though, fluent in vim in a week sounds like bullshit.

    message: Guys, if you really are a Geek, you need to be capable of learning mutiple
      platforms and architecture and EMACS is a platform and an architecture :) Also,
      you need to configure and write code and scripts and EMACS is all about that.
      You need to know shortcuts and be able to learn quickly, EMACS again. Don't
      fall for being a one trick geek who just makes websites or write databse queries
      :)
