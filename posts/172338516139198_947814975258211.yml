      Not yet ... I will use 10 Build 10125
      "Windows 10 release by the end of August. Or, technically speaking, by September 22 – the day before this year's autumnal equinox – if you want to put an exact deadline on it."

      I'm waiting for the final version.
      Sticking to Kubuntu for now. although It has performance issues with my system (Windows 8.1 worked fine) but I really like it.

      Exploring it ...

      Took me almost 2 hours finding the compatible drivers for it ...

      Some Technical Bugs at installation and some bugs at some settings features  ..

      But it's a well done relating to the UI and speed .. "till now" .

      Needs more customization options

      Spartan deals well with new html5 and css3 technologies ...

      IE 11 is still here :O !

      Cortana is nice here ... however I don't know it's the same performance on windows mobile devices ? if yes .. why all that love for it ?

      BTW any one got what meant by slow update cycle ?
