message: "Hello guys, \n\nI made a web application for downloading Pluralsight course's
  videos.\n\nThe main functionalities are:\n1- Downloading videos without depending
  on other applications(e.g. IDM).\n2- Be able to save entire course videos in a folder
  structured way with order.\n3- Display the number of raters of a given course which
  is not displayed on Pluralsight website.\n4- No need for valid subscription for
  free videos.\n\nYour feedback is highly appreciated. If you think it's illegal,
  kindly tell me."

    message: One of my friends told me that he has an account and he used a tool to
      download the courses automatically, then Pluralsight detected the heavy requests
      from his side and contacted him. They thought that his account is hacked in
      the first place.

      The reason Pluralsight offline experience sucks is their author royalties system. They pay authors based on how many minutes how many users watch.

      That's why even if you have the annual plus subscription that allows offline viewing they limit you to using their apps for download/view. It's a major complain because even their apps suck too.
