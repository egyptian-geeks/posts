  Hello,
  I know how to code in C but not professionally. I'm thinking of taking a course or more to understand more about the syntax of C++ OOP, data structures, algorithms and design patterns.
  I found online courses but I'm confused about the arrangement of those courses. Could anyone help with that?!
  Thanks in advance

    message: i think learning syntax only will be boring somehow and you will not
      learn a lot if you didn't apply what you are learning (on a project or some
      tasks). You'd better do both simultaneously (C++ syntax in parallel with algorithms).
      Data structures and algorithms always go together because data structures are
      helpful in the way algorithms are applied on them.

      Object oriented programming in c++ by robert lafore, this book is addective and so the writer.
      at least read the first chapter "the big picture" and i'm sure u'll fall in love with the book.
      but c++ won't get u anywhere expect it'll help u understand a lot of coucepts in an abstract manner... my advice if u wanna learn is to apply... there's a lot of direction u can take, depending on your objectives.
