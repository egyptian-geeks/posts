  Hello,
  I know how to code in C but not professionally. I'm thinking of taking a course or more to understand more about the syntax of C++ OOP, data structures, algorithms and design patterns.
  I found online courses but I'm confused about the arrangement of those courses. Could anyone help with that?!
  Thanks in advance

    message: i think learning syntax only will be boring somehow and you will not
      learn a lot if you didn't apply what you are learning (on a project or some
      tasks). You'd better do both simultaneously (C++ syntax in parallel with algorithms).
      Data structures and algorithms always go together because data structures are
      helpful in the way algorithms are applied on them.

      Object oriented programming in c++ by robert lafore, this book is addective and so the writer.
      at least read the first chapter "the big picture" and i'm sure u'll fall in love with the book.
      but c++ won't get u anywhere expect it'll help u understand a lot of coucepts in an abstract manner... my advice if u wanna learn is to apply... there's a lot of direction u can take, depending on your objectives.

    message: "Algorithms,  and design patterns , and C++ are different topics. You
      can find whole books focusing on each one.\nOnce you are familiar with C++ syntax
      and basic features: go a head with learning more about OOP, STL and templates.\n\nI
      would recommend the following two books:\n**C++ Primer:for learning C++ features,
      STL, and memory managment.\n** Data Structures and Algorithms analysis in c++:for
      \ algorithm and data structure analysis and implementation in C++.\n\nMy recommendation
      is to use the following books:\n- C++ Primer (https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1467916865&sr=1-1&keywords=c%2B%2Bprimer)\n\n-----
      Chapters:1 -5 covers the basics.\n------ Chapters 7, 13, 14, 15: (You learn
      about OOP) \n----- Chapters 9, 10, 11, 17 :covers C++ library, STL and templates.\n-----
      Chapter  12:  will learn you about dynamic memory managment and smart pointers.\n---
      At the end of the book there is also a good summary of new features in C++11.\n\nBut
      if you are looking for an algorithms book, that focuses on implementing algorithms
      in C++, then I would recommend:\nData Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-C/dp/013284737X"
