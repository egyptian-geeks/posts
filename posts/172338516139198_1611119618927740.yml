  only need someone to lead this meetup in Egypt, someone who have the potential and
  the event management awareness, he/she should be someone awesome in his/her field.\n\nI
  can help him/her as a vice for the management process and any other staff, I have
  the potential of sharing knowledge and making good debates, but I lack the event
  management and these staff. the is me on Quora(https://www.quora.com/profile/Abdelrahman-Hamdy-1).\n=================================================\n\n*So,
  please mention your super hero geek in Egypt in whom you believe, and you think
  that he/she can lead this meetup.* \n\nWe need to discuss who can lead us, then
  he/she can post \"Who is going to the Quora World Meetup in Egypt  during the week
  of Nov. 6-11?\" on Quora to collect the guys who will attend from all over Egypt
  from different backgrounds(not only computer geeks).\n\n*Please don't post this
  on Quora before having some discussion together about who can lead us.\n\n* I'm
  sharing the same post on \"Egyptian Big Data Geeks\" group, so you don't need to
  share it somewhere else I think.\n\nThanks."
