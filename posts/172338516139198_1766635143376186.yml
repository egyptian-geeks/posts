      There is iMac and iMac Pro for you...

      4K display at laptop size is useless since you need to scale at 2x or 3x to see anything... and if you need to do something that needs 32GB of RAM or more, then again, a Mac laptop is sure not the right device for the job ;)

    message: "The MacBook uses an intel chipset that doesn’t support DDR4 or more
      than 16GB. \nThe Retina display is good enough for 95% of the users, and Apple
      likes the 2x magnification model it used with the display, so it doesn’t want
      to go higher before it can do 3x or 4x while maintaining their profits."
