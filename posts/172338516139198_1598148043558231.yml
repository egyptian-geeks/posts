    message: There is no visa sponsorship in Germany. Convince a company that you're
      the best fit, get the offer, sign the contract, and you're done

      them that you are a fit to their needs and get an employment contract. \n3-
      Battle for 4-6 months with the joint forces of Egyptian and German bureaucracy\n4-
      Congrats, you are done\n\nA list of some of these companies can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EohVGGwrFN9isFPbSilg7N413yMtKX2URF8YDYhOeIM/edit?usp=sharing"
