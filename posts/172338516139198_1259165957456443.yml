  i just want to say this

  the situation in Egypt became very boring
  why we are "small" people?
  most companies do BS work, you rarely find a company that do serious computer science related stuff, or just do what they do right

  what should new programmers do?, work for this companies and then just move to similar one that just bigger?

  i have been in companies that have so called "seniors" that know nothing about computer science

  i have a lot to say on this, but i know that no benefits from writing it, i would just be happy if i don't feel this alone

      I know your feeling. In Egypt companies apply what has been already founded in Business Solutions. The main reason for that is we actually don't have any CS research universities. Like for example, The University of Berkeley is mostly dedicated to researches while the MIT is balanced between researches and applied CS. The real problem is the lack of fund or grants, I have a cousin who lives in Canada and he once requested a robot worth $50K for researches, and the university (Waterloo btw) had already had this robot in its labs so it gave it to him just like that.

      New programmers should first work in startups where they are most valuable to the company as a whole, also they will be responsible for a lot of tasks since the man power is relatively low. Once they acquired good knowledge (and self-confidence) they can then work in big companies (preferably abroad with the exception of Embedded Hardware/Software companies as they are well established here)

      The Danes were able to create business solutions software that became a billion
      dollar industry (i.e. MS Dynamics), the Fins created a world class mobile phone
      company. You can compare Sakhr to Microsoft that both started at the same time
      and had similar chances. The idea is to grow from small to very large you need
      to have the vision, mindset, hard work and above all Allah's divine help. We
      create clones of other companies and call the innovation and inspiration, therefore
      the results do not surprise me.

      software, but even the ones that succeeded, very quickly fail because they don't
      have vision and sustainable growth models.

    message: While it's great to watch other success stories, it is also great to
      inspire yourself with having an ideal, a moral code and a dream. To succeed
      your dream shouldn't be to be a millionaire or to be one of those <sarcasm>"inspiring"</sarcasm>
      people speaking at TEDx. The idea is to be good at something you love and feel
      passion for. I always laugh at the startup scene version of inspiration because
      it is so commercial and marketing driven. I am talking about real inspiration
      that comes from your heart.

      We are retarded in all aspects of life, even the simplest stuff in the daily life, for example we still fail to collect and recycle our garbage properly, we fail to drive on the roads properly, we fail to control our currency, we fail to have a modern and efficient government system... etc, ..

      then why you expect us to be advanced in computer and technology and be surprised of being retarded in it as well ?!!!!!

      Environment matters !

    message: I disagree with those who see us as a complete failure, if we start with
      knowing who we are, and why we are here, then we can have a balanced life,  which
      is the basis of success. Without knowing that, we become blind rats in a maze,
      blaming the walls for our predicament. People have been successful in Russia,
      China who some would argue were oppressive regime and many have failed in freedom
      homes :) The root cause in my humble opinion is what I wrote above, we forgot
      who we are, and why we are here, the family has been hacked, moral codes have
      been breached, we need to fix that first. Mostly the anger I sense is more jealousy
      at not succeeding than anything else, you need to reach balance first before
      you can go anywhere.
