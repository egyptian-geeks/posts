  I do believe that music streaming is yet a big industry with all of the services available in the market.

  One thing I’m wondering about is why Anghami (The music streaming platform) doesn’t yet have any competitor in the MENA region?

      licensing, not a lot of MENA entrepreneurs can raise this kind of money.

      Digital content in general is risky as piracy is the norm and no strict regulations to protect you

      Other key players are telecom operators; besides the user generated platforms like mawaly, 6arab, mazika ..etc
