      For me I'd say, All of them.
      I get bored easily & quite quickly, so even in entertainment you should keep the challenge curve dancing.
      Some days I'm not in the mood and prefer to just chill and watch a movie, horror is my favorite.
      Other days I'd call some friends n hang out, some fresh air and a good laughter sure helps.
      Others I'd play some PES or Gunz( pretty intense pvp game ), i strongly believe that games keeps your creativity up.
      at the end of the day, find what best works for you. cause while someone can love skydiving others would be terrified to.

    message: I used to play PES and go to cinema to charge up and make a real rest
      . And recently I used to go to gym at the morning  and started a piano course
      . Unfortunately all that didn't make the real rest for me to charge up again
      to give me power to code more and learn more yet. It helped a little but not
      much as I expected or I want . May be going trip somewhere would help .

    message: I usually play an hour or 2 of Team fortress 2 (game) and maybe go for
      a run(though I used to run 6:8 miles every day), I hate drama to be honest so
      TV is not something I ever think about and most of the time online mmorpg/offline
      games are really good to the point of me wasn't whole days playing them so I
      usually steer away from them

      Physical exercise is both fun and beneficial, working out a couple of days/week really takes the edge off and clears your mind!

      Personally I do Jiu Jitsu (a martial art) 3 times a week and it does the trick.
