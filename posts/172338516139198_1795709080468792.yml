  times, but just normal speed for files in general, So in this case, I think Normal
  HDD would be better.\nWhat do you think?\n\nNotes:\nIt is a laptop\nI don't like
  using external HDDs, unless it's wireless rack!\nNo CDRom to replace\nNo NVMe port\n\nPossible
  solution is to use the Card Reader with 120GB Class 10 Card, But SDCards are known
  for sudden death without any signals, So could be less reliable!\n\nThe first post

      للاسف عن تجربه مش هتحس بفرق كبير
      انا كان عندي lenovo وكان معاه ssd 8 او 16 جيجا msata cssd وكان شغال cache للهارد الاساسي يعني كانه هيبرد بالظبط
      والفرق كان عبيط جدا
      لكن لما كنت بعطله كنت بشوف المرار
      لكن مش هيعمل فرق زي مانتا متخيل
      مادام هتجيب جهاز للشغل او dev. عامتا يبقى هات ssd حتى لو 120 جيجا

      are on ur HDD. I did that and the difference in speed is overwhelming

    message: web/nodejs developers also need to work on ssd not just system to boot.
      they read and write and observe 80K+ file every build so they need to work on
      ssd or it will take forever to render

    message: Get a Linux OS, as a base OS on an SSD drive for boot 256 GB is more
      than enough. 100 GB for boot partition and home directory, the rest for data,
      then add an HDD for slower storage.

    message: Kinstone A400 SSD(s) are cheap (120GB for about 800 EGP I think) though,
      it doesn't have Dram which means it's a bit slower and on average might live
      less than an SSD with Dram on (around 20% less lifespan depending on how much
      you write to it and how much free space does it have)

    message: If you're looking for performance, and don't care about the big capacity
      of the HDD, then you could buy a 120-240GB SSD. SSDs are getting cheaper. If
      the capacity is more important, then HDD is the only option unfortunately, but
      if you decided on HDD, try to look for 7200 RPM, it's a little bit faster than
      5400 RPM, and clean the dust of your notebook often to avoid performance drop-downs
      because of nothing.
