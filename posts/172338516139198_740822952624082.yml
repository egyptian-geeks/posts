message: "It seems that Waterfall is finally and officially dead!! The DOD (traditionally
  largest backer and funder of CMMi) now is required to use agile practices in software
  projects..\n\nDOD issued the New Approach report that requires DOD to use agile
  practices in its acquisition of IT systems:\nhttp://www.afei.org/WorkingGroups/section804tf/Documents/OSD_Sec_804_Report.pdf\nThe
  SEI has issued a report analyzing DOD’s report:\nhttp://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/11sr015.pdf\n\nThe
  report recommends among other things:\n• A multi-level planning approach and a time
  boxed delivery manner. \n• New approaches should embrace the value of “80 percent
  solutions” (as appropriate).\n• Tangible evidence of relevant development capabilities
  in the form of prototypes or deployed systems (“working software”) will have preference
  in an evaluation with a commensurate decrease in paper-based proposal components.\n•
  Embrace the concept that incremental and iterative development and testing, including
  the use of prototyping, yield better outcomes than trying to deploy large, complex
  IT network systems in one big bang.\n• Requirements management process will be adjusted
  to reflect time boxed development constraints and allow for uncertainty. \n• Prioritization
  and further definition of requirements will be an ongoing activity.\n• Development
  efforts will focus on what can be achieved in the short term.\n• Development will
  involve continual test and evaluation with user involvement.\n• Test and evaluation
  will be structured to support iterative and incremental delivery. \n• Testing approaches
  will make extensive use of prototyping and automated testing."

      1993 and worked with Ken Schwaber to formalize Scrum at OOPSLA'95. Together,
      they extended and enhanced Scrum at many software companies, helped write the
