  #Angular2 #Angular1x
  For large scale apps built with angular1.x, when do u think the right time to switch to angular2 given the huge investement a startup has to make to componentize the entire app that in many cases uses advanced ui components like terlerik n others...
  please keep in mind that even popular frontend UI framework like bootstrap have not been yet componentize, JQueryUi, MD2 and most of the ui modules built by the open source community!

      I think that you can make it on steps ,, you can start by migrating your whole app to components under Angular 1.5 ,,, then start migrating 1 component at a time to Angular 2 ,, till you finish it [You can run Angular1 and Angular2 at the same time],,
      there's a port from Angular team for bootstrap 4 to ng2

      There's a course on pluralsight about migrating to ng2 name
      "Preparing for and Migrating Applications to Angular 2"
