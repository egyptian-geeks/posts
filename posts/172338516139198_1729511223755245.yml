    message: "Something about how he explains the error in DNA-to-Face construction
      doesn't sit right with me. Does 80% success rate truly mean 100% accurate reconstruction
      of 80% of the subjects? \n\nFrom my understanding, 20% error rate depends on
      some form of error function and for something as big as face reconstruction
      I don't think the error function would be as gross as he implies.\n\nAnybody
      read that study?"

    message: Responding to your question. I can say, yes it has become that good.
      But like any machine learning based technology, your model is as good as your
      data, if you have small datasets your model will not generalize well and as
      such won't be good enough for general use. Governments and giants like Microsoft,
      Facebook, Google and Apple, on the other hand, have massive datasets on which
      they train models that generalize well.
