    message: yes I'm using it for Node.js apps and Meteor.js (For learning) but My
      colleague at work is using it for commercial products. the only problem i see
      is that you can't provide your clients email addresses on the server. they only
      give you root access and you setup everything from the terminal ;)

    message: yes that's because they give you the server with root account and they
      are not installing anything. this is not a managed servers so i don't recommend
      it for any body that doesn;t  know what he is doing. it's for people who knows
      how to configure and deal with linux servers.
