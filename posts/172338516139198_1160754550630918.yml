message: "Ok , this post re the latest Twitter leaks we discussed earlier.\n\nI was
  discussing the same thing with someone who believes that its not a malware , its
  a leak from inside twitter \"The guy is the CTO  of a security Agency which serves
  CNN, BBC and some big cats so.\"\n\ni got so many surprising info from him \"which
  im not sure 100% is correct\"\n\n1- As i said he believes its not a malware  \n2-
  Twitter uses SHA-1 and many others \"which is easy to recovery , i think couple
  of minutes should be enough\".\n\nSo what i think -or need to discuss- is that \n1-
  how come all of those does not use a 2nd factor and risk context assessment too
  !\n2- HSBC uses a simple  but nice method , they doesn't store passwords in hashes
  instead i think its just encrypted, then they ask you for a random combination of
  your password not the full one like \"1st 3rd and last digits only\" , which prevents
  all kind of malware , MITM  , however still raise high risk for insiders attacks.\n3-
  (EDIT) if we got 36 million hashed password we will need about 70 Years to recover
  it , however this might happen in a distributed system.\n\nAny thoughts from our
  Security giants here ?"

    message: "i still think it is far fetched to say this breach is from twitter internal
      system, if someone can read twitter internal database there are some more profitable
      things to do than sell the passwords\n\nTwitter does not use SHA-1 to hash passwords
      , they use bcryt \nsource: https://twitter.com/_mwc/status/740764470708965376\n\nyour
      source is mistaken hashing passwords for serving certificates which they do
      use SHA-1 for \n\ni still need more proof to even consider the possibility this
      was not done by malware \n\nand i think your HSBC example is wrong or misunderstood
      or at least i hope so, hashing is way better than encryption in case of password
      storing because in encryption the key have to be stored somewhere but in hashing
      there is no key"
