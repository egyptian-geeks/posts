  Good day geeks,
  #Career_Question

  What do you prefer and would pursue as a #softwareEngineer:
  (a product-based company)
  OR
  (a service-based company), and WHY??

  Note: please don't advise me that it depends on me and what I want.. just assume that I don't know and you are in my position and tell me how YOU would think about it?

  Thanks a lot ♥️

    message: Do you mean product vs service in the literal sense? Or product company
      vs consulting company, that makes different software for different clients?

    message: "Definitely Product-based. Because on the course of X years you are working
      to improve one single product. From a prototype to deployment...to growing user
      base (scalability), feature additions, sometimes pivoting, ...etc.\n\nTechnically
      you learn a lot more. And you work on a large code base, with data pipelines,
      architectural changes, migrations. You get to see the effect of early bad/good
      design choices on future requirements. \n\nIn a software house it's usually
      a the repititive task of creating a website or a mobile app. If it works, you
      deliver and start all over again. It gets boring very fast.\n\nLook at the most
      valuable tech companies in the world. All of them are product based."

      a product-based company
      Because dealing with new clients with different mentality or dreamy applications' requests is a pain in the .... head  and mostly they are doing their app in the wrong way and they are stubborn about it, but dealing with professionals in your company is better for sure and developers aren't this stubborn when it comes to developing something in another way .. I mean when they find it better they do it or at least give you some reasons why it's not suitable in this situation unlike clients who "عايزها كده"

    message: For the project based company it's actually depending on the project.
      Some startups are more interesting than others depends on the team and the technologies
      , spending some time developing a growing project allows you to gain more skills
      and be able to handle the changing requirements and understanding the business
      needs.in The service and consulting company you might learn a lot of things
      and tools but you will not be an expert in anything. And some times you might
      become "obsolete" developer depending on the projects and the services in the
      company . It's your choice but in case you like stability over hard work and
      knowledge the service might be more stable than small product based companies.
