  - I've heard that before, why is this time different?
  -- The direction of the Windows platform.
  -- The new age of Cloud computing and vertical integration.
  -- NSA, NSA, NSA
  -- Raspberry Pi and computers on a chip.
  -- Linux is now on more platforms than ever.
  -- Innovation in the Open Source space is much more than in closed source space.
  - Moving to Linux as a User (on the desktop).
  - Moving to Linux as a developer (on the server).
