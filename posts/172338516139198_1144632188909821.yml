  here experienced unexpected behavior while using the conditional operator (aka ternary
  operator) ?

    message: First of all sorry for the late response, I was trying to append a string,
      and I used ternary operator to check the returned value(String) of a getter(if
      it's null or not), it throws a null pointer exception, Althogh I used the same
      syntax with another getter of the same type, it's value was null but it didn't
      throw any exceptions and continue the condition normally
