      monitor your system to see which application is requesting that, `sudo journalctl

    message: "I had a similar problem 2 months ago, the DVD tray is opening once pressing
      the power on button, even before the boot process, and never close even you
      tried hundreds of times, it has nothing to do with Ubuntu, I'm on Windows, i
      tried some tricks, it worked for awhile, and for some reasons that only God
      knows it worked normally again \U0001F602, i don't even want to try to open
      it now to check out if it's working, i better keep it closed than forever open
      \U0001F601\nWhat is your laptop model?"

    message: check crontab tasks if a job for ejecting the /dev/sr0 exist ! .if not,
      in the crontab ($crontab), write " @reboot eject -i on /dev/sr0 ". this should
      prevent the dvd to be ejected via its button since i suspect it may be a hardware
      fault. if this doesn't help. you may try doing again in crontab " * * * * *
      eject -t /dev/sr0 ",this will close the tray every minute. the worst scenario
      i think if you aren't comfort with crontab, rename /dev/sr0 with another name
      ($sudo mv /dev/sr0 /dev/sr0.tmp ) and if you need to use dvd,return to the name
      to sr0 . this evilly should cut the connection between any userspace app try
      to communicate to the DVD HW .( probably the file will be created again at reboot
      automatically from kernel, so you may add the command of mv to crontab again
      :D ). these are just workaround solutions and never tried before but no harm
      will happen if you tried them.
