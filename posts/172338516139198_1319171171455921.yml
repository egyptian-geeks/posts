  clause belong to a category. Categories are saved on a different table. Both clauses
  and categories are editable by the user.\nWhat I want to do is to create a page
  where these clauses will be grouped by category. \nEach clause should have a check
  box next to it allowing users to choose what applies.\nI'm not sure what ASP controls
  to use. I thought about nested repeaters but the idea isn't appealing. \nI also
  think a combination of a repeater and a gridview will also complicate things. \nIt
  will be ideal not to show empty categories. \nI'm pretty sure you geeks will impress

    message: It's more simple than using repeaters you could use a drop down for the
      categories and 2 list one for assigned sentences and other for unassigned looks
      like 2 pools

      I totally agree with you but I forgot to mention that the client is absolutely strict. They really wanted this way.
      Currently I'm thinking about create custom user control. It will contain a header for the category name and a repeater underneath it for the associated clauses. Then programatically create those controls from the code behind for the non empty categories and fire them on the page.
      How does that sound to you ?
