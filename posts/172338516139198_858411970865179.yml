      It seems that Godaddy is the provider everyone loves to hate (their ads are silly with so much sexism, their support is overwhelmed with so many customers, their owner was hunting elephants illegally or something like that and they got even more bad press for it), might be the cheapest as well and at some point in time everyone had their DNS there then moved.

      name.com is nice and namecheap.com is nice. Name.com n old days did bad things like capturing *.your.domain and making any sub domain you didn't register (if you didn't register * wildcard) be valid domain still and display ads in it. They stopped long time ago.

      I moved from name.com to namecheap.com and didn't see that much difference, maybe name cheap SSL is cheaper or something (I don't remember) but that's about it.
