      Nope, there is no good alternatives. Try https://www.winehq.org/ to run it on Linux, speed was not that horrible the last time I tried it a few years ago.

      If you got enough RAM, you can also install a seperate VM with Windows to run it there, also.

      inkscape could work
      it is basically illustrator alternative but could be used depending on what you want to do

      1-ممكن wine فعلا مع cs4 بس ساعات بيعلق و بيطلع errors عجيبة
      2- ممكن تخلي gimp كله كأنه فوتوشوب حتي بالاختصارات و كدا

      work well with psd files from Photoshop , also it is not GPU accelerated as

      and it isn't free nor opensource, it requires to replace some buggy dlls and
      do some work arounds.\n\nAnother option is to go to the wonderful photopea https://www.photopea.com\nWhich

      Guys, the guy is very clearly asking for "open source alternatives for Photoshop on Linux"
      Dual booted Photoshop on wine is neither open source nor an alternative!

      You have a few options on linux:
      1. Paint.NET
      2. CinePaint

      For web-based:
      1. Pixlr
      2. SumoPaint
