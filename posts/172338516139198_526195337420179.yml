    message: Smart and simple, I achieve similar grouping using the TestGroup attribute
      in Nunit so I can group related cases together, but this approach in the Phill
      Haack blog is better

    message: I do like this approach but some people consider it bad as you now have
      nested classes in your test and I know that they are right in this point but
      it makes organizing related tests very easy

    message: "Well if you don't use CTRL+M CTRL+O it kindda makes the code hard to
      read specially that \n\nmost people (at least the people i know) expect one
      class per file and that's why I \n\nthink using public nested claases is not
      good approache because if you are gonna make \n\npublic why don't you make it
      in a seperate file?. But in the testing scenario once you \n\nget used to it.
      It's nice"

      but it has the extra benefits of \n1) Grouping of related tests\n2) Shorter
      test names"
