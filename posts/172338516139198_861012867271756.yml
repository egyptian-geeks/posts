    message: "I went through its code quickly; I wouldn't use this in a real application
      or performance-critical ones for reasons:\n- it uses one context for each GPU
      device. this means that multiple processes can read/write unauthorized data
      from/to GPU memory. a quick solution is implementing a software memory management
      unit (MMU), however, this would just decrease the read/write performance.\n-
      this is a user-space library, for example: it uses the command queue in opencl
      and C++ to manage read/write workloads. these operations can be enhanced using
      kernel-space modules.\n- by design, it should be slow as noted from the developer
      description. it is not thread safe, so it uses mutexes in reads/writes. I believe
      that the performance will drop in concurrent read/writes ..\n\nFor example,
      the tested GPU card would give you >200 GB/sec memory bandwidth, however, the
      achieved bandwidth is about 2 GB/sec which is 100X slower! \nWhen we write code
      that reads/writes to RAM, we expect a transfer rate of 5-10 GB/s (more or less
      based on the used RAM), one simply wouldn't provision for this large decrease
      in the transfer rate resulted from poor implementation of this library, especially
      with the comparison of RAM price vs GPU price. \nHowever, I think this is a
      good effort, and better implementation(s) will make it an interesting library
      to use or investigate. Also, it will be interesting to implement this in distributed
      setups."

    message: I like it that you have been through the code, but it says right there
      in the intro that it is for fun and not intended for production environments
