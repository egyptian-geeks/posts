      When the product costs tens of millions of dollars, speed and size aren't really that much of a concern. As a matter of fact, flight control on the A320 isn't even written in C, but in a declarative language (Lustre), which apparently lends itself better to formal verification. I suspect it has a much worse optimizing compiler than what you get with C.

      Are there even MISRA-C-like safety coding standards for assembly?
