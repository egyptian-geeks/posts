  Hi Geeks,
  I am creating an Android application using Phonegap. It should use database of about 8000 items. it's my first time in my life to deal directly with database. So I have these problems can u give me some hints or tutorials ?
  Problems :
  1. How to convent an MS Access db to be used in phonegap project and which db better and easier to use in phonegap locally ?
  2.  How to make a page for every item from db dynamically while I use HTML/JS only ? for example item1.html
  3. how to autocomplete search input from database first column ?
  4. How to dynamically link the search results to the dynamic pages created ?

      just build one page for viewing the item\nyou just send the item id to the page
      controller to get it from DB and view it in the page\n3- I didn't make it locally
      before, but when using it with a server it you will use ajax to search database
      with query like this \n\"SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE $variable%\"\nuse

      You need data embedded into the app or stored on an external server ??
      For framework use IONIC it is built on top of angular and I consider it as one of the best, don't go for Jquery mobile or Kendo.

      Why you need dynamic page ??

      and which db better and easier to use in phonegap locally ? ---\n\n1.1 Exporting\n\nExport
      your Access tables to CSV, and then to SQLite or something else http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11086770/how-to-port-an-existing-ms-access-to-sqlite-for-use-with-android-app-developemen\nYou'll
      have to export images to folder with some convention.\n\nTry googling exporting
      MS Access to SQLite, I found some old results like https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/how-to-convert-an-access-database-to-a-sqlite-database.78/
      and the answer above\n\n1.2 Which database\n\nAll the options are listed here\nhttp://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/6.x/cordova/storage/storage.html#page-toc-source\n\nYour
      best bet might be the SQLite database, as I expect it to be the closest to your
      existing model.\n\n--- 2. How to make a page for every item from db dynamically
      while I use HTML/JS only ? for example item1.html ---\n\nYou need a JavaScript
      based router like sammyJS or the various AngularJS router libraries or react-router,
      etc.\n\nAlso check https://ccoenraets.github.io/cordova-tutorial/routing.html\n\n---
      3. how to autocomplete search input from database first column ? ---\n\nYou
      can look up any JS autocomplete based widget. Something like AngularJS or react
      etc will make these sort of things easier (you'll still need to get some autocomplete
      plugin),\n\nThe widget should give you some event or call a method you provide
      or something, then in this method or event handler you call your DB with a SQL
      statement (say `select Title, ID from MyTable where Title starts with @input`<<pseudo
      code>>).\n\nThe specific call and syntax will differ based on which DB you choose,
      and the way you return this to the UI will depend on which autocomplete component
      you use.\n\n--- 4. How to dynamically link the search results to the dynamic
      pages created ? ---\n\nTypically you'll use some sort of JS template like the
      one in underscoreJS, or like Angular / react / Ember /.... \n\nYou'll generate
      HTML dynamically, it might be something like:\n\n<ul loop=\"item in dynamicItems\">\n<li><a
      href=\"{{'#/items/' item.id }}\">item.title</a></li>\n</ul>\n<<pseudo code>>\n\nThe
      particular syntax will depend on what template language you use. Of course you
      can also just make the strings manually in JS and have `someTargetElement.innerHTML
      = generatedHtmlString;`, but going without a framework will take forever for
      so many tasks."
