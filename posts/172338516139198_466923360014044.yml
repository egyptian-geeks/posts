    message: Fiddler is a great tool as Mohammed pointed out, also there is FireBug
      Net panel, YSlow plug-in and another more of an all-in-one solution New Relic.

    message: Doing this, it seems to me that you have so many JS and CSS files, that
      are exceeding the limit of parallel downloads and had to be queued, some of
      the files are a bit big too (over 100K). The solution? Consider combining files
      together into single file in production, and maybe minify files as well.

      with combining the files.
