  ولا ملهاش علاقة بهندسة البرمجيات ؟

      If you are interested about problem solving skills, I would recommend websites like topcoder.com or codeforces.com and seach for the topic that you want to train on after you have read about them from other sources.

      About using them daily in your job or not, it highly depends on the nature of the projects you work on.

    message: Khan Academy is also great and so is code academy. HackerRank.com and
      codility.com are also good for testing your skills. I would start easy, get
      used to writing code, like swaping variables, comparing, create a sort interface
      and have a default method that swaps variables, then get every sort class you
      write to implement the interface. Just start very easy, and incrementally get
      harder questions, don't feel like you have to rush into anything. The smarter
      person is not the one who learns quicker, but the one who understands deeper,
      and that person might take more time than average but once he gets the concept,
      he flies past everyone else. An good example of that was Einstein.4

      If you choose to be become web developer... you won't use maths at all ... or
      Maybe a little algebra for design calculations ..\nIf you will work in Control
      System.. you won't use Single Variable calculus, you will use multiple variable
      calculus, a lot of Maths theorem...... Although you will use Matlab for working
      these calculations out, \nbut it's much better for to understand what does this

      متخصصة جدا. حتي عالم برمجه الالعاب اللي المفروض معتمد اعتماد كلي على الموضوع
      ده, مبقاش محتاج ده غير لو هتعمل engine من الصفر ومعظم الشركات مش بيعملوا كده

    message: Actually, this takes passion for learning out of the equation, you can't
      just say "why do I need to learn?" or "what's in it for me?", if you have passion
      for learning you will excel. At one time it was not common for people to know
      statistics, now statisticians who know computer science are called data scientists.
      It is true that you don't need even year 10 education to become an every day
      web developer, BUT, why not dream of doing more? Or being multidisciplinary?
      A programmer who just does web pages is OK, but a programmer who understands
      a business vertical will probably have a much better career. Also, mathematics
      can be used in many fields, you don't have to force yourself to learn, but if
      you find that learning maths is fun and you are capable, then by all means expand
      your horizons. In my experience, there were times where my mathematics background
      and knowledge of business gave me hindsight that even the company owners couldn't
      know, I would tell them how wrong a decision was or suggest a better decision,
      but they would find out I was right 2 years later. In the end, knowledge is
      power. A guy who knows only one platform and OS can get a job, but he cannot
      compare to someone who knows multiple platforms and has the capability to dive
      into technologies and science easily. Plus with the advances in robotics, solar
      energy, data analysis, there is always room for a brainiac to expand his horizons.
      Just don't limit yourself.

    message: To be honest guys, I want to stay away as far as I can from web development,
      I know it's the dominating field and I know it would be hard to land a job in
      a development field other than web. But i've been a web developer for 2 and
      half years I guess, And i'd really love to move to something more, scientific..
      that requires something more than just doing CRUDs and laying out pages... So
      what i got from what you guys said, that knowing math is required in only some
      specific fields.. I think i'll have a shot at it.. despite not having a job
      so far :D
