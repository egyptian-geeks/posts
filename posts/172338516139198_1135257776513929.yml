message: "Is there anyone here worked with Apache Spark using python?\nI have a very
  strange problem. I wrote a little spark streaming job that monitor an HDFS directory,
  read the newly added files, and send the date to Kafka. \nWhen I try to submit the
  job I got an error (ImportError: cannot import name KafkaProducer)\nThe error is
  simple as you see, the script can not import KafkaProducer module. The problem is
  that I could import it from python shell, ipython shell, and pyspark shell without
  any problem. \nWhat do you think the problem is? \nHere is the code of the job\n"

    message: "After alot of tries I could solve the issue but the solution is weird.\nSimply
      I made \ncat old_file.py > new_file.py \nThen submit the new_file.py and every
      thing worked fine. \nI have no idea what is going on. This is the second time
      I am facing this problem with python scripts. \nI posted another question but
      this time on serverfault instead of stackoverflow by this problem as I think
      it is an operating system caching or something like that.\nHere is the link
      if anyone is interested \nhttp://serverfault.com/questions/774275/python-script-can-not-import-kafkaproducer\nI
      hope getting an answer.\nFinally, Thanks for you guys."
