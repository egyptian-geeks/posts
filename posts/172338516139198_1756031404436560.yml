      1- Performance: React native is compiled to native while all the logic happens in the javascript thread. It's way better than ionic in this area. However there are still caveats when it gets to animations and so on.
      2- Learning Curve: I'm not sure if this is only me or what, but I found React Native to be easy to use and work with. Sometimes people argue that writing html and css might be easier for those with web development background, but that's debatable.
      3- Community: Ionic has bigger community to be honest. Sometimes in react native you will spend sometime until you reach/find a solution to an issue. So it might take longer to do the same task on react-native due this, but it will be a "cold-start" so it should be much better/faster on the next time. This doesn't mean that react native's community is bad or anything.
      4- Tooling: Rect Native Rocks! (that's for me)
      5- UI Components: It's the same as community comment (They're correlated somehow)
      6- Market: If you mean as a developer, then react native. It seems to be requested by many companies and it has more potential vs ionic and other native frameworks (Some say because it has facebook behind it, others say because it's more intuitive, whatever the reason)

      Wait for others' comments anyways as this may not be the best feedback out there xD
