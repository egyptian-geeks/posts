    message: "Mohammad Tayseer, yup, you are right, should have remembered to remove
      them :) \nAmr Eldib the project simply captures any given area on the screen
      and  outputs it an animated gif file, unlike recordit and gyazo, the file is
      stored locally instead of uploading the file and outputting the link,\nwritten
      with c#, .net framework V3.5, I assume it could be ported to Linux using mono,
      should give it a try later"
