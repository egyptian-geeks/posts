    message: One more thing that I'll try using next time I make a git repo for a
      unity project is to use Git LFS to handle large binary assets, it should make
      cloning/pulling faster.

      +1 on using Git LFS and I advise everyone to use it in any new Unity/game/binary-heavy project and from the beginning before adding any files, track all the regularly updated binary files with it. It would be so smooth to setup on client side.

      In game projects the repository could grow 1GB per month easily. It was actually a good reason for older projects to stay on SVN, we recently migrated to Git LFS and we're now almost stable at 330MB and increasing only a few MB's / month :D

      The thing is though, migrating those binary files from the history to Git LFS is tricky and time-consuming, unless you're ready to throw the history away (or in some backup fork of the repo somewhere) then might be easier.
