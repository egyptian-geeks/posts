  Hello ,, I was searching about connecting C# desktop application for accounting system like (sales software for supermarket as example) , I want to connect it with php website ,The functionality will be that the users will choose products in the website and ask to make order then this order will be shown in the desktop app for the supermarket owner so he can send these products for the customer ..
  I found that i can do this by APIs but someone told me to make the database for both is same ,, So really i can't determine how i can do this .
  NOTICE: the app is ready and has hundreds of products.
  Here are some links that i found while searching in this issue :

      de-validate cache is very problematic.. so just avoid it."
