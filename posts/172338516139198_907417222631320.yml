  Turning EMACS into a Python IDE, you will never know the pleasure of coding until you do it on EMACS with auto complete :)

  P.S. it took me ages to find this, I spent a week trying to do it 2 months ago but I gave up, then this made it very easy and I got to enjoy it finally, I couldn't sleep out of pure happiness. I am still looking for a way to set up a short cut to run the code in the buffer, would appreciate some Geeky input here

      I tried emacs & vi. I didn't like any of them, because they are completely different universes. I use vi out of necessity. Sublime gives me the power of these editors, building on top of what I already know. I used to work with Notepad++, but Sublime has better keyboard handling.

      With Sublime, I use Anaconda for Python integration. Anaconda can work with virtualenvs as well. Djaneiro for Django & jinja2 syntax highlighting. Emmet for HTML.

      I'm using Django when I can. Flask cover all other cases that Django doesn't cover well.
