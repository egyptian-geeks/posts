message: Programming is hard work. It’s an intense mental activity. Good programmers
  think about their work 24/7. They write their most important code in the shower
  and in their dreams.

    message: "I disagree with every single word you just said :) A Good programmer
      is a Good Problem Solver Who Think about solving his problems without writing
      any single line of code. \n\nWriting code should be only an execution process
      when you write a code to the problem you already resolved in a documentation
      or on paper/Whiteboard. \n\nand once you get to this level writing code will
      not be that exciting. and you won't write as much code as you normally do. but
      the less code you write is the better approach to have less bugs."

      your words is a reflection of what I've posted :)
      you have said exactly what I meant by every word, that's why we (write) the most important in the shower, not with the keyboard :D
