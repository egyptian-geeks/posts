    message: A friend of mine who was one of the Linux pioneers in Egypt predicted
      that there would be Linux everywhere, and that people would create applications
      deployed with Linux as it was so lightweight and resource frugal. This was back
      in 1998 and I remember a very tough conversation I had with him, I was totally
      against this "nonsense" and told him to stop living in a cave :)

    message: This could fit very neatly in a use case  for micro-services deployment
      by the way, since I see people wondering.  I can imagine a very light OS with
      just the JVM, or .NET core and this would be a very neat way to deploy and scale
      the microservice components

    message: Also a piece of useful information, is about Docker, which coupled with
      Vagrant can provide for a very useful solution for deployement and scaling at
      will. https://www.docker.com/what-docker
