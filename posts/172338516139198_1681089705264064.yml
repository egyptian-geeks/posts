message: "Hello everyone, \n\nI need some advice regarding a project topic. I’ve asked
  my professor and he suggested ‘Botnet using docker’ or ‘IDS using docker’. What
  I asked for is security implementations mainly in clouding. Do you think these are
  good projects in terms of importance and freshness in the security or clouding field.
  \n\nMaybe the question is a bit naive but help me out anyway \U0001F600\nThanks
  in advance."
