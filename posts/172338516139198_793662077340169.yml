  are google ads something that I should fear ??!!
  I recently got to know Neo4j  graph database .. and suddenly I can see many ads about it in many websites that I visit !!!!
  do you see these ads yourselves?!! or does it really  relate with my browsing experience ???

      Yes Google is doing that all the time :)
      They see what you've searched about and they deliver ads that matches your interests.. And in all cases I stopped trusting Google for a while now

      Actually Microsoft did a huge ads campaign to raise awareness for users and to get some benefits itself it's called the Scroogled ads
      Check this one:

      You can try duckduckgo.com, I think that was the name, it respects your privacy.
      Also, use Firefox as your default browser.
      And don't use android.
      I have encountered the same thing when I started learning Ruby on Rails, tons of ads either offering jobs as a developer or offering education resources. So yeah, google is more snoopy than a paranoid girlfriend.

    message: That's how you pay for the great search service. Nothing is really free
      you know. That's also how you get personalised search results, and again, that's
      how Google makes money from search. They allow you to disable personalised ads
      and personalised search results, but this doesn't necessarily mean they don't
      collect the data (for tends. etc). Of you are conserved, use DuckDuckGo instead.

    message: frankly I didn't know that they are taking that much of data .. i think
      its a problem if google knew what is my topics and search affinity .. at least
      they should reveal their compiled data about me and my behaviour and/or give
      me the chance to delete my footage from their servers. [[ who knows what are
      they keeping and what not ]] .. now I am thinking of hacking their coockies
      to send false information about me .. so that I F* their analysis algorithms
      :(
