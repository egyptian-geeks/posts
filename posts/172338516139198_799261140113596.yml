      Are you sure you tried Google? Here are some search results.

    message: I found this http://linustechtips.com/main/topic/40055-ubuntu-boot-loader-error/
      by searching for this "boot loader read error usb". Note that the number is
      probably random based on which random file was corrupted so it doesn't help
      in searching. Also, I have found Google sometimes confused by symbols like "/",
      ":", "@", I'd usually replace them with spaces and/or put quotes around the
      "../../.." string.
