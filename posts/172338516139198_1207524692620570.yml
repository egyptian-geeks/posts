    message: Is it possible to have framework that implement SCS ? I feel like building
      the system using single framework is against SCS somehow ?

    message: "SCS is not about the internal implementation of any system (technics,
      frameworks or tools) it is about breaking big giant monolith system into multiple
      self-contained ones\n\nthis is a very good story which can clarify the difference

    message: The problem with throwing these concepts around in my experience has
      been that there needs to be a lot of background knowledge as well as business
      knowledge to have even a glimmer of hope of success and it needs an Architecture
      organization to manage the governance in an enterprise. IN places like Egypt
      where most enterprises just need an ERP and a web site, this will be over-engineering
      and will lead to a risk. If you work for a software house and they are developing
      a system for an Enterprise, then they must have on board Architects with a vision,
      a transitional architecture and a governance model, and moreover a deep understanding
      of the business vertical and the concepts of DDD, Enterprise Integration patterns
      and Solution Architecture. This is non-existant in the vast majority of mid
      east companies and especially in Egypt,

    message: Not against gaining knowledge and I totally hope that IN EGYPT this stuff
      can be done, the issue is the management of the enterprise has to be mature
      enough for this. They need to be mature in creating visions, transitions and
      governance, all of which the vast majority are not, Then come the techies who
      wonder why the latest group of articles, although they seem totally logical
      cannot be implemented in their "applications", the point I am making is that
      SOA, Microservices, Reactive Architecture are at the Enterprise Architecture
      scope and unless that level of oversight and knowledge exists, which in 99.9%
      of cases (the 0.1% being the ones that might exist) does not exist, then hoping
      to implement microservices is just a dream or a shot in the dark. You need a
      strong mature business enterprise, strong mature management, strong mature technical
      leadership and competent Enterprise Architects, which would have to have at
      least one leader with real Enterprise Architecture experience. We are also talking
      about implementations in the millions of dollars, so that rules out all but
      the very largest Enterprises which might be your cell phone providers and I
      am sure their Architects come from the mother company.

    message: I am just clarifying so that when we have dreams and run into this lack
      of ability to implement what is in the book due to push back from management
      or an ignorant PM like I have run into multiple times, we understand why. One
      PM fought my SOA architecture for a system and supported by management thought
      she could do the work the "simple way", a month later she walks in crying to
      the team saying she failed because she was rejected by the techies at the customer
      side and 6 months later the project failed, as a repetitive story it helps to
      understand why that was and why the managers seem so blind, and the real answer
      to that is lack of experience and knowledge or ignorance in one word, from the
      techie side, it is lack of business understanding and lack of ability to sell
      the merits of the Architecture when he is not being taken seriously as just
      a techie, because in Egypt either you are a techie or a business guy and you
      can't be both, we get to the point that people display their ignorance or technology
      to prove they are business people, one of our major misconceptions that has
      led to paralysis of the IT industry, the hope is for enlightened techies who
      understand business.
