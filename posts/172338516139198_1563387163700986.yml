  To everyone whom chose programming as a career he enjoys, I wonder after working for like 3 - 4 years, do you still enjoy programming in general ? Or did it become just an everyday job that you get paid from ?
  And what would you do If you lost motivation at some point ?

    message: "I enjoy how things do change in programming, and embrace that change
      myself. New technology stacks, frameworks, projects, problems, It gets funny
      how things were done yesterday compared to every today. Also, everyday challenges
      can always have a way to surprise you, trigger you to have a new adventure.
      But for the repetitive tasks, I always try to automate those to avoid being
      stuck there, and get to work on something else. \n\nHowever, these things are
      closely related to the environment, which is broad yet effective, the projects
      you work on, other programming tracks, and advanced tracks you might want to
      tackle.\n\nSo, no, it never gets boring for me unless it's something about the
      environment."

      As everything in this world, there are ups and downs. This has been my career for 12 years now and I still do love it. I enjoy the moments I find the solution for something, I get frustrated when I'm stuck, just like when I was new in the job.

      With all do respect to any other opinion but if you don't enjoy what you are doing anymore and it is just a job to pay the bills, then this is not the career for you.

      I still enjoying programming .. and it is my favorite thing .. but I don't enjoy the career itself .. you know, you don't always doing what you want .. sometimes you doing what your manager/client want.

      when you lost the motivation try to do something else, any other hobby that you have, for short period of time. let's say in your weekend. it will help a lot.

      First it's "who", whom is used to ask about the object المفعول به while who is used to ask about the subject الفاعل

      Next, I have been programming for 8 years now and I still enjoy it, even though my original plan was to quit programming after 4 years.
