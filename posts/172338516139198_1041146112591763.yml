      Excellent writeup. Honestly where I work we are engaged in most of the decisions in the company. Not just me but most of the developers. The decision of using a technology or doing something is also left to us, no body tell you strictly what you should do unless you are clueless or junior. We also get recognition when we deserve, almost with every success we have :). Guess I am lucky :D
      What I can relate to from your article is the interruption. That happens almost everyday! Also the 6th point, but I don't really know if it's valid or not ... Developers should be aware of the critical situations the company is facing. Some stress is good sometime it can bring the best or the worst in people.

      and they forget that we use our mind to solve problems and not our body.'
