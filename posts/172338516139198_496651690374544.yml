      1- A state machine to replace MS Workflow 1.0, in cooperation with Meligy :)

      2- Rawa7.com (but it can be more beautiful ;) )

      3- Customization of SimpleStateMachine DSL to include more directive

      4- A library for wrapping Symbian controls

      5- A library for string shaping & justification, used mainly on Symbian & J2ME. Many years later, I found out that it's used - without permission - by a well-known & large mobile application company in a lot of their applications

      6- Quran application, on J2ME platform, showing Quran in beautiful Othmani font, on devices which doesn't support Arabic
