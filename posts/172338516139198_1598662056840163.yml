    message: I took CS50 while doing another studies and currently I am taking CS50
      again while studying many other stuff like ES6, React and even a great basics
      course on udemy to recap what I learned and build something creative with a
      different instructor, all what you need is to measure yourself and your capabilities,
      manage your time, get yourself comfortable with accomplishing consistent tasks
      per day, and set a long term goal, good luck.

    message: As you said you can manage your time and do both of them that will give
      you more knowledge. In other hand, the CS50 course isn't related to front end
      development but better better for you to know about the concept of computer
      science
