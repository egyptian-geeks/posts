  I'm sure you guys heard about the new iOS 9 ad blocking.

  So the way ad blocking will work on iOS 9 is that the ad blocking software will detect where requests are being made to and if it's identified as from a known ad server, it blocks it.
  There's a massive opportunity for someone to develop a more distributed kind of ad server that allows to serve ads from a bigger network of servers, or even make a self hosted version that will allow anyone to easily host their own (openx and similar servers aren't for your average user at all).
  Think about it and I'd be v interested to figure out how we can develop something like this.
  In case you think ads are evil, well they basically power up most of the internet.

      If this is the only method that is being used to block ads than u can work around that. There r several techniques already used in the hackers community for botnets.

      One way it to make it distributed like torrents.
