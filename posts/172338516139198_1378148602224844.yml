  Good morning guys.
  I'm looking for WhatsApp API or SDK to be able to sending messages through my App, I found several on github but it doesn't work, Have anyone ever seen or already know a good & healthy API for WhatsApp?

      there is no formal API or SDK for WhatsApp ya Omar Negm
      even if you found something working it will be based On reverse engineering the app requests and will be blocked after a while.
