      Mohamed I think a better title would be "The advantages of moving to Linux". The current title will guide the audiences subconsciously into the old argument of Windows vs Linux.

      The question "Is it time to move to Linux" can't be answer generically, as you know those kind of decisions are per project, environment, and market.

      it was one step towards their own Linux based OS "SteamOS"
