  While reading Code Complete book, I saw this great paragraph about distinction between programming in a language vs. programming into a language.

  "Programmers who program “in” a language limit their thoughts to constructs that the language directly supports. If the language tools are primitive, the programmers thoughts will be also be primitive.

  Programmers who program “into” a language, first decide what thoughts they want to express, and then they determine how to express thoughts using the tools provided by their specific language."
