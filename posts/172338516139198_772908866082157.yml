    message: Addy Osmani from Google is loving it, and it may be the reason (guessing)
      it was used in Google web UI starter kit. I find the numbers more useful though,
      so, even if Gulp is better, most often (not always) you find more plugins ready
      to use with Grunt than with Gulp.

    message: I think I might give it a try. . But just like what you said Grunt's
      community is larger but for me most of the plugins I use are written for Gulp
      too..

    message: Its much better than Grunt. I used both of them and i recomeng Gulp over
      Grunr. Google released a new Ui framework based on Grunt as well.

      I used both & switched to Gulp, much better.

      Here is Google web-starter kit using Gulp https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit

      The best analogy I heard about Gulp was from Christopher Coyer ... Basically with Grunt you have to do a lot of things manually. Let's say you are compiling Jade templates into HTML then concatenate the JS files and replace the group of links with only one then minify the HTML ... In Grunt you define the temporary folder where you store the HTML files after being compiled from Jade ... Then tell the next task to scan the files at the temp location and replace the tags with the new one and overwrite the temp files again then tell the minification process to act once again on the files in the temp location and finally copy it to your *build* directory ...
      With Gulp it is totally different ... It's like chaining with jQuery ... For the sake of simplification it would be like:
      htmlFiles.CompileJade().replaceTags().minify().moveToDist()

      also that Gulp's community is getting bigger

    message: The Problem with Grunt is that it's not easy to remember the syntax and
      it gets messy in big projects. i've used it in http://livefyre.com and it was
      awesome back then because it was the only task runner back then but now i really
      recommend Gulp after seeing it's usuage!
