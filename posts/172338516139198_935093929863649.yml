    message: 'Tomahawk is designed as a strategic weapon, e.g. long range attack on
      large fixed targets. This article mentions that it can be used as a tactical
      weapon, e.g. hit a moving convoy. This means that Tomahawk needs to get updated
      info on target location, possibly from different sources: a marksman, a tracking
      device, a drone, or a satellite.'

    message: Yes, this update is directed towards close air support. The US is considering
      wide updates to its CAS systems, even including replacing the iconic A-10 Warthog.

    message: If you're talking about the plans to replace A-10 with F35, then I don't
      think it will happen. F35 has a lot of problems AFAIK.

    message: 'I remember reading on reddit a while ago that there are two parallel
      lines: one for replacing the Warthog with a better plane, and another for getting
      the F-35 into the field. Those two lines tackle completely different domains
      and should not intersect, but money talks after all and this might end up actually
      happening.'
