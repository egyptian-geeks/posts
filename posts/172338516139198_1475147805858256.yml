      Two catches: FUN3D is export-controlled, so while the code is freely available to any US citizen, it's not officially available to anyone outside the US. Second catch is that the core, mathy part of FUN3D is written in Fortran, a mostly infamous programming language that was developed in the 1950s and is still favored by some scientists but isn't very popular with general programmers.

      Those are two huge catches :D
