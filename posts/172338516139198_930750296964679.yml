  Anyone experienced with a good WordPress duplicator plugin that actually works and would recommend it to me?

  .

  I'm working on some theme changes for my WordPress blog. I got a local environment easily with bitnami installers. Now I'd like to test some of my posts using the theme in a local environment.

  I'd love to be able to install a plugin on my production site, get a ZIP file, install the same plugin on my dev (local) site, upload the zip file, and get all posts, categories, tags, media files, plugins, and configurations (site + plugin) set for me.

  I realise I could do some file transfer and SQL crap, would love to avoid that though.

  Does anyone here have a **FIRST HAND** experience with such a plugin
  (I'm obviously not looking for Google results :))
