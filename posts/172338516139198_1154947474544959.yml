      wonder if it's valuable to a software engineer?

    message: "Technically computer science started as a branch of discreet math. \nReality
      wise, in these days, you rarely need to have the knowledge of some advanced
      mathematical theories.\nPeople in the field of CS need to have a very strong
      mathematical background in less than 3%-5% of CS fields, for example:\n\n1-
      people who design knew algorithms, and by design here, I mean formal designing
      of new algorithms that require mathematical proofs like designing a new compression
      algorithm\n2- in very certain areas in game development. Like those who build
      the graphical pipeline and physics engine (in these days, people mostly use
      middleware for that)\n3- data scientists.\n\nIn short, if your target is to
      be a very strong software engineer, then there are much important fields that
      you should focus your time on"

    message: Not sure if this adds to the discussion, but sharing my little experience.
      Phenomenally strongest "smartest" engineers I have been fortunate to work with
      were surprisingly Math. graduates - either Ph.D. or Master holders. Not a rule
      for sure, but my guess Math. develops the brain efficiency in some ways :) May
      be I am wrong, just my thought!

      Im studying a CS major curriculum and it got discreet math, calcus and probability.
      They are there for a reason.
