  Hello everyone
  There are a lot of posts about VPN and SSH in Egypt recently.

  Can I ask you please to refrain from making general comments on these posts, and only comment if you have some status update to add (something working, something not working, asking about specific detail in previous update, etc), or providing solutions / workarounds?

  This way finding useful information on these posts will be much easier

    message: It's worth explicitly saying that this is a personal request not a group
      rule or anything. You are free to ignore the request even that I think this
      won't be in the interest of these posts.
