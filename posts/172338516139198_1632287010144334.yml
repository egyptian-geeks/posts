    message: I used Jira, TFS, FogBugs, and BugZilla, my favorite is Jira, also whatever
      can totally integrate with other CI/CD pipeline, like source control, build
      and Deployment, both Jira and TFS have great Integration within their respective
      ecosystems.

      Jira is the best software development tool used by agile teams but when it comes to bug reporting in mobile apps you will spend effort and time reporting and filling bug details and then much time in reproducing the bug and trying to fix it, so you have to use Instabug that will help your team and beta testers report feedback/bugs from your mobile app and Instabug will collect all required information for your dev team to reproduce this bug and fix it faster. and you can integrate it with Jira/trello/github if you don't want to change your workflow.
      Give it a try and let me know if you need any assistant, anyway it won't take more than 1 minute to integrate https://instabug.com

    message: Jira, it's not about the bug tool itself, its about the integrations
