message: "I am developing my personal website, basically its an API, i want to write
  some nice front end to it, but i don't wanna go the Angular way, nor the reactjs,
  too complex and noisy. i just need something simple, i like the Aurelia framework
  style, but its too complicated for my simple website, right know i use knockout
  for each view \"but i just render views from the server\". so i just wanted a small
  framework that could be knock out with a router ? i saw pager.js but i didn't like
  it.\n\ni dont like front end dev but i have to do it for my website -_- \nif i got
  bored i will just render from the server :v \nany recommendations ?"

      Angular 1 is e simplest this will get client side wise, especially if you need a router. If your needs are really simple, you can go with the built-in in router instead of ui-router. That's as simple as it gets if you want rich client with no client side build.

      Apart from that, there are things like the JavaScript capabilities in Rails 4+, or react .NET for .NET, that makes react pretty simple.

      Or you can simply drop the API idea and do stuff on the server as much as possible, maybe with returning HTML in some Ajax requests if needed, and/or with a little jquery as needed..

      If all you need is a router, sammyJS usage with knockout was popular in the old days (Durandal days).

      for me, will give it a shot first before trying other tools.
