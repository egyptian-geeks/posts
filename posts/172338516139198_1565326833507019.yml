  Hello, i'm managing a facebook page that gets too many requests via page inbox, i'm trying to find a logic that i can separate each request with its category, so i can select what category i want to show its requests. the user will choose the category for his request.

  to make things more clearly.
  I see Etisalat Misr page uses facebook page tabs for customer care like this :
  https://www.facebook.com/etisalatmisr/app/177719422276650

  how could i achieve something like that? i think that is a web page embeded in a facebook App and the App added to page Tab, or embeded directly to page tab without apps, is that correct?

  Thanks.
