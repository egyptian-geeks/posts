    message: Can you elaborate more on your question? The camera should list its hardware
      system requirements for recording and playback, and with a decent internet connection
      (>10mbps) it should be possible to stream.

    message: "Yes you could do this\nBy using ffmpeg lib for android and transmits
      the packets over udp /  rtp multicast \nWithout modifying the input codecs you
      will receive the full packet with real time streaming \nYou maybe face issues
      with your network like lagging our router turning off \nSo you need some switches
      support MVR like Cisco managed switches our you you could broadcast over rtmp
      protocol to a local server like red5 bout in this case you will need to transcode
      video and audio to suites this protocol and will cost your mobile device great
      CPU usage use h246 as video encoder and aac as audio encoder \nI'm also build
      a commercial solution to solve this problems \nHappy coding \U0001F642"

      your router is the main throttle point

      forget about the theoretical 300mbps

      you will never get half of that even if you are setting on top of the router

      and for wireless bandwidth is shared among the devices which makes it worth

      i started to get a good streaming results when i got an AC 1900 router
