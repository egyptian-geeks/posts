  sleep without knowing my latest news, I now also installed MonoDevelop, not because
  I need it to Run VSCode, but because after installing Mono Libraries I thought I
  might as well.\n\nNotice in the second picture how much RAM is being used although
  I am using Pycharm and Mono and Iceweasel with multiple tabs. \n\nThis is exactly
  why I really love the #linux platform and HD space consumed with all the software
  I installed, including the web server and Eclipse is still 4.44 GB RAM.\n\nI guess
  I can easily run this machine on a USB drive and take it everywhere.\n\nFor those
  who need physical proof I attach this pic"

      Actually that's a big misconception about people comparing the overall RAM usage to the performance of the system. What you need to actually compare is the page faults because the architecture of RAM caching is totally different between Linux and Windows.

      For example, when you use SQL Server under windows, the server process would be taking almost all your free memory, does this mean that it's actually using that much memory? Short answer is "NO", long answer, well, it's very long, but what I can say is that is takes over the entire memory and create a huge memory pool to decrease page faults and memory loading to the minimum. Same thing is actually done by Windows since Windows XP (lookup the "Cached" section of your performance monitor for windows)

      long while, will look this up and try to understand more. But I will say, Debian
      is quick, it doean't clog my resources, and it would be great  OS as a host
      for many VMs.  Also, subjectively, nothing has ever crashed running for weeks
      at a ed on debian even after weeks of continuous use. IF I do close everything
      I get back to 150- MB RAM which would imply great memory management :)

      I would give you an example. Windows has a feature (since Windows XP) called super fetch, here you are some info about it from Wikipedia. If you just used memory usage as a comparison between systems, then you would reach the conclusion that Windows is using way more than Linux, but the fact is, it is not:

      I never said it was rubbish. What I am saying is, with Debian you get an operating
      system that 1. Has low footprint 2. Is reliable/stable 3. Has tons of free tools
      and doocumentation 4. Is absolutely free 5. You can go for months or maybe years
      without seeing a crash

      I dont see a crash on my system too and I only restart it when I have a forced update which is like every 2-3 months.

      As for a low footprint/USB system, you can look up something like Windows To Go (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_To_Go), the whole idea is that if you wanna the system to have a low footprint, you can disable all these services (but then you would have a much more page faults rate and worst performance) but you would get a very low footprint

      building a reliable driver, so when the driver has any problem, it takes the
      entire system down. You dont see that problem in Linux because the amount of

      In the end I can run the VM I showed you on 1 GB RAM. I actually give it 2 GB
      RAM and it works like a charm. If this were windows, it would be at least 8
      GB and the VHD file would be 100 GB. Here the VHD file is like 10 GB with half
      empty. Plus everything is FREE of charge and FREE of ads and license requirements.
      Everything is just mine, to do anything I wish with it, to change code, recompile,
      rebrand, I can put my picture and call it the Mohamed Samy OS (extreme), in
      the end I can know every little secret I want to know about the OS, AND it is
      very small and I can carry it around on a  small USB drive.  I can change the
      binaries, the code is feels like I have absilte authoruty and it really is exciting
      when you get things running. Windows always is bloated and the options are so
      limited. Start with the GUI, why would I want a server with Touch screen interface?
      At least let me chooose :)

      Who told you that you can't choose?! You can do everything, but most people don't know they can!
      Plus I am really tired of the idea of "I can change the OS as much as I can" because frankly, how many people who use Linux know how their way around kernel debugging and OS programming?! It's useless unless you can really change the OS code!
