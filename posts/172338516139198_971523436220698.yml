    message: I believe the browser is the new OS, so if this browser is going to capture
      market share they need to make it run on Linux and Mac.  This can be the platform
      they base their applications on similar to Chrome and Chrome Apps. But just
      having a Windows version is a disadvantage at this point in time, they could
      use the browser to deliver offline Office Apps to other platforms (I know there
      is Mac office), with something like VS Code built on JS, I believe this is in
      the making.

    message: So basically, browsers will become Virtual Machines, kind of like the
      vision for JVM of write once and run anywhere.
