  Question to geek friends, has anyone recently been having difficulty accessing your overseas servers?
  We suddenly got cut-off from some of our severs (we still can access the rest). The weird thing is that we cannot reach them over any encrypted port (ssh, VPN, etc) even on different non-standard port numbers.
  We got this response from a provider.
  Moreover, when we tried to access them from outside Egypt everything worked fine.
  When we troubleshoot the thing we find out that the connection is established but certificate negotiation fails. It seems out a####le government is installing something that messes up certificates on the way.
  Does anyone know if this is a temporary situation or if they will incrementally cut-off services ?

      I understand that you are suspicious, but even if they were intercepting packets,
      they would just read the data or store it, so if they change the contect on
      the message and resend, that is something you can detect with network monitoring.

      We suddenly got cut-off from some of our severs (we still can access the rest). The weird thing is that we cannot reach them over any encrypted port (ssh, VPN, etc) even on different non-standard port numbers.

      When we troubleshoot the thing we find out that the connection is established but certificate negotiation fails. It seems out a####le government is installing something that messes up certificates on the way.
      Does anyone know if this is a temporary situation or if they will incrementally cut-off services ?
