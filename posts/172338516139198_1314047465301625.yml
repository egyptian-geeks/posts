  or not.\n\nAnybody here knows some good resources to give the sense of the maximum
  'requests per seconds' for the most common technologies.\n\n// More just to explain
  what I mean.\nFor example what will be the bottleneck for ROR deployed with unicorn
  on a server managed by Nginx, how can I estimate the max Requests per second for
  each?\n\nI know there is lots into this topic, lots of OS included, networks and
  more. If you got any helpful resource please share.\n\nThank you."

      I guess this can help, it calculates benchmarks for different frameworks combinations. and it's really awesome. but I guess you should also test you own design and configuration.

    message: You could use apache jmeter to do load tests then you have an idea how
      much your whole system can handle, also while doing that you could log how much
      time of it did the database take and how much did the other layers take, just
      to know where the bottleneck is, if any
