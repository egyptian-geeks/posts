      I try to give a heads up before to make sure that the client knows there is a danger to missing the deadline, with constant communication of where I am, what I have done and what I am working on. I also give them an option of other paths like reducing some requirements that may lead to meeting the deadline but not exactly the product they intended, maybe missing some features or some feature not as clean as they wanted.

      if you split the project into tasks, and put deadlines for those tasks (using sprints for example to group tasks together in a period of time), then you can have missed deadlines that are recoverable by changing requirements or that the client knows about, days or weeks in advance.
