    message: Betternet is good, but you shouldn't use it all time because it's gonna
      make your internet slower. If you really need to use one, you should buy one
      like ExpressVPN.

      I've been using betternet for several years now on IOS.
      For browsing namely with chrome use the extension called Browsesec which I have been using it since a really long time and it's great even in streaming.

      another VPS and build an SSH Tunnel to hide your VPN Activity and the ISP or
      the GOV will never know you are using VPN, the traffic will appear as SSH connection
      and you can pass any firewall without your VPN being blocked :)'

      Depending on your usage, if you just need it for browsing just download the Opera browser and use its built-in VPN.
