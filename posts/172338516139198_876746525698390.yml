  Guys,

  Are many people here using Resharper? I would like to know is it good and do you actually pay to get it?

  Thanks

      you can download a trial for 30 days (And 30 more days on the EAP version, which isn't intended for daily use)... for me IntelliJ's PHPstorm has really been sooo fascinating for me that I all of a sudden decided to start using an IDE on what I used to call a "light interpreted language that needs nothing more than just a super fast editor" :D --NOT A C# guy here, but if their quality is similar to Android Studio, Webstorm and PHPstorm I'd directly recomend it to a friend :D --but yes again, use it for a month on a real project and you'll tell if u like it more than whatever u're currently using or not :)

      EDIT: apparently they don't have a discount program for people using other (commercial) tools like they do with their PHP and Web versions because apparently anyone writing C# is probably using another commercial tool :D

      absolutely boring to me, while new technologies seem like the sexiest thing
