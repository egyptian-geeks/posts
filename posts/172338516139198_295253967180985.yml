      One man is smoking and leaving smoke rings into the air.
      his girl gets irritated with the smoke and says to her lover:

      "Can't you see the warning written on the cigarettes packet, smoking is injurious to health!"

      The man replies back: "Darling, I am a programmer. We don't worry about warnings, we only worry about errors."

    message: Once a programmer drowned in the sea. Many Marines where at that time
      on the beach, but the programmer was shouting "F1 F1" and nobody understood
      it.
