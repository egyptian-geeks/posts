      I would recommend TFS for .net development
      We are working with tfs for 5 years and we can customize its work item templates to match our needs and it has a good api and documentation
      Tfs has strong integration with Microsoft test manager if you choose it for your testing

    message: TFS is a powerful platform indeed, but I faced some performance issues
      when I used it (both online and on premises). JIRA on the other hand is faster,
      much user friendly and easier to use. Having worked with both, I would recommend
      JIRA if you are going agile. In general, both tools can be used only as  task
      management, not as project and portfolio management (some plugins are available
      for JIRA to do this but for extra cost though).  When you build your workflow,
      make it as simple as it can be, it is a tool at the end to help organise your
      backlog, and shouldn't be a burden for the developers to do their work.

    message: TFS is awesome for bugs tracking and with MTM for test cases writing
      & execution too, i dont recommend Jira at all as it's really chaotic
