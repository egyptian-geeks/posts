    message: I've read about his plans to release this browser long time ago. He was
      facing a law suit I think cause Opera implemented some of his plans without
      his approval, not sure exactly. I would definitely try it cause this guy was
      awesome.

      it's ok, if it is built on chromium then it won't be a new browser then, differences

      Mohamed Osama I am kidding man ... The thing is, when people mention Opera I remember the old browser based on Presto ... The version that I loved ... The first browser ever to introduced multi-tapping, the first browser to implement gestures, the first browser ever to pass Acid Test 1, 2 and 3 ... The first browser to have decent built in developer tools (Dragonfly) ... The fastest browser in the earth ... The browser that was innovative.
      Little shameless self-promotion
