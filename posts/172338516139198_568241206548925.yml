    message: JetBrains is great company actually, ReSharper is one of the most amazing
      product they have I've ever used. Even Google collaborated with them to use
      there IDE to build the Android Studio

      Many people love it, especially who do Node or Angular JS on multiple OSes. I bought it in December (Mayan's world end day sale was crazy, got it for $12), but it felt very unnatural on Windows, even the v6 upgrade (the licensing gives you a year worth of upgrades even major versions).
      I also tried WebMatrix 3, not bad at all, but to this day, VS+Resharper are my toolset for JS.

      its not a feature in the IDE it's a template engine called Jade  very similar to haml templates for ruby apps. http://haml.info/

      and the refresh page while writing you can get it from liveReload: http://livereload.com/

      i usually don't like this type of IDE I'd prefer working on something like VIM or Sublime Text. which you can customize to do the same features and it's better actually. Zero Mouse usage :)

    message: Quoted from Meligys's Article ... In the last 6 months I've used no less
      than 5 different ones... each time I learn just how valuable Vim is to me. VIM
      FOR EVER :D
