    message: True but also include incompetent HR, and blind upper management who
      don't have a clear business plan. Sometimes people stay for the supervisor,
      but mostly the supervisor may leave too because of poor management vision and
      poor business environment. Once an HR person completely destroyed a company's
      technical team then she cried to the people remaining in the team claiming it
      was the management that made her act so badly. needless to say she left and
      the company crashed and continues to crash...
