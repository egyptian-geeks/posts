    message: "I have cats and I understand a few of their gestures, but in many cases
      it's hard to know what they want (I have one who just wants me to follow him
      around the apartement :D), sometimes it's better just to ignore them (3ashan
      mayetdalla3oosh awy :D), I remember that Google once made an April Fools app
      called Google Translate for Pets or something like that :D\n\nEdit: Relevant

    message: dogs are much more expressive, if they need something they would stand
      close to it and keep barking, cats on the other hand are lazy, they would only
      move and try to communicate if they needed food, otherwise you have to magically
      figure out what they want :D

      This is so true :D
      When dogs are bored they try to catch their own tail, when cats are bored they hunt invisible monsters in the room :D
