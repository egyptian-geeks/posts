    message: These *strange* rules are here to help us control the quality of contributions
      to this group. It also reduces the amount of spammers and fake accounts. And
      there is no *wasta* or anything similar these rules apply on everyone including
      the admins.

    message: Yes it's a wasta if you're going to give exceptions to people who have
      friends/colleagues who are having trouble joining. Either you have a process
      or you don't.

      Perhapse I wasn't clear enough. Take a look at this account:
      - edit: account link removed.
      Can you extract any information from it? Can you judge if he is a good fit for this group or not? In the past I used to message people who try to join with profiles like these but it's an exhausting process. All I mean is for the students coming from Alexandria Univ who are studing computer engineering if their frieds requests are being rejected just message us.

    message: Hi Ahmad, I can't judge either way. People do have the right to privacy,
      isn't there a way for people who want to join to fill out a short form? Messaging
      people for sure is the best way, if it's too much work I'm sure others would
      be happy to help out.

      I can't disagree but in this specific condition (students from the same faculty with interest similar to theinterest of the group) I thought it would be easier for everyone to make that exception :)
      Thank you for raising that point and perhapse I won't do that in the future.

      People who want to hide their relevance to IT from us shouldn't be asking us to be in our group - no hard feelings.

      We need to verify the profiles because we get weird non-tech accounts sometimes asking completely unrelated content or spam, and it IS a lot of effort even for such a big number of admins like here.

      Does this sound arrogant? It kinda is. We think there are a lot of great beginner groups and many of us are helping others in these groups, but this one group is kept as an advanced / elite one.

      Of course if an admin knows that someone is relevant to IT, we might not need to go through the usual inspection, although I doubt any of these profiles had nothing to do with IT in their public content also.

      The point is getting anything relevant to IT to save us future headache we often have (so it comes from need and experience not just cautious about something that never actually happened).
