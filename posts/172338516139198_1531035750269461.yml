      The CV looks pretty good. Just as a general piece of advise, try to make your work experience into bullet points instead of paragraphs. Instead of 'I am ...., I also ....", turn each one into a bullet point.

      Also to be realistically speaking - and I don't mean to get your hopes down - but it'd be usually hard to get a job abroad when you have only few years of experience (I see you only graduated last year), so you have to be patient until you get positive responses. It may take sometime but eventually isA you will make it ;)

      My dear
      I didn't find your power in development (organized, number of projects, specific development area OOP, technical documentation) you need to build some skills in order to get hired

      To be completely honest i think ur filling ur CV with a lot of paragraphs. People don't want paragraphs they want a 1 to 2 words that describe what you know and how good u do it.
      Second thing is with all due respect but you concentrated ur knowledge on PHP and a couple of it's frameworks with the abstract JavaScript. If u r a backend developer what about task runners and deployments? If u r a front end developer did u try react or vue? Which version of angular do u mean in ur CV?
      U see these are questions the employer ask themselves.
      In my opinion i disagree with mohamed on the point of little years of experience. It's.ore about what you achieve in these years not their count
