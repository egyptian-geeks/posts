    message: I'm using WebStorm and yea it is very powerful and clean. The only issue
      in it is that it doesn't have recovery options so if the electricity cut off
      suddenly (In Egypt this happens a lot :D ) , don't be surprised if you find
      ur code corrupted.

    message: You use version control when you finish after you save.I think he meant
      when the electricity goes off while you are coding. Sublime returns you to the
      same state before it shut down but that's not a deal breaker for me. I have
      been using sublime for so long I am more productive with it. I tried webstorm
      out of curiosity and it's awesome but I didn't feel the turbo charge I am getting
      from sublime.

    message: Yea , I used git too to avoid this problem but I just wanted to clarify
      this problem because many people won't find it easy to use git. Also you don't
      save each second so you may lose some lines of code even if you just saved before
      the electricity goes off :D

    message: There is no "save" in WebStorm (or other JetBrains IDEs) per se, changes
      are immediately saved as you type. Could you please elaborate on the electricity
      problem?

      save files for granted.
