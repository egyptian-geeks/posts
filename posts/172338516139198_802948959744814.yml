  I wanted to wipe the HDD in my laptop as I am selling it, and was researching solutions online when I came upon this "built in" solution for Windows.

  Windows 7 (and 8) has a cipher.exe that is used for drive encryption but can also be used for wiping. Just execute:

  cipher /W:<dir>

  Where <dir> is your drive/directory you need to wipe. What it will do is write zeros on that location, and then write ones, and finally write random values.

  Just thought of sharing. And btw, Linux geeks, no mocking :D

      Technically, I remember that this needs to be done like 7 times because it would still be recoverable even when you wipe if and rewrite it once (I never did it myself but I know that theoretically, it does). That's why the old DoD protocol for wiping HDD was like 3 passes and now it's 7.

      A very good and free tool that does that is called Eraser:

      I think if you want to recover files after an overwrite you have to take the magnetic disks inside the HDD and put it in a specialized machine that can detected tiny parts where the magnetic field wasn't fully switched by the overwrite.
      Basically it's done via special hardware and not software, so you need to be working in the CIA for someone to care enough to go through with that procedure :D

    message: then how would you be able to access the information via software? Even
      if you somehow communicate with the HDD directly and not through OS APIs, how
      will you let it read the leftover magnetic fields?

    message: As I said, I don't know exactly but a technician in a police station
      in US (not CIA or NSA) was able to do it to a device I owned which was not only  overridden
      once, it was also encrypted and the key deleted and he was able to recover a
      lot of data which at some point I thought to be impossible. So imagine the tools
      available at higher level then

      Mohamed Moshrif: you are correct about the 7 times issue, but note that restoring data which has been overwritten more than 3 times is not possible using only software solutions.
      it is only possible using a combination of special hardware & software, which is somehow impossible for individuals to get hands on.
      that's why when you are using a wiping solution, it will have a preference to wipe 3 times (usual standard) or 7 times (government standard).
