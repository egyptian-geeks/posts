    message: "There's two big things these days Data science and IOT \nEveryone is
      doing IOT, it's easy and quick. \nNo one is doing data science it's hard and
      takes time\nso i'd suggest the 2nd one. to find an idea just think about what
      data you can collect from our daily life and what decisions can the computer
      take based on that. for example I'm doing a simple project these days just to
      record what I'm doing with my time on the laptop... I do the recording half
      manually, then the app should give me hints about how to maximize profit/time
      ratio based on that.\n\nOther than that, if you don't like the first one and
      you don't have for the second one, you can make a game maybe using Unity. I'm
      doing that for my graduation project by the way, I think it's gonna be fun :D"
