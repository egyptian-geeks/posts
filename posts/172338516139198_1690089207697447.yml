  Hey guys,
  Anyone faced an issue with hibernating after updating windows to (Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709) ?
  -------------
  Update
  Okey, Suddenly I found a solution, not sure if it is the only solution because I already tried dozens of solutions and recommendations during the last couple of days.
  It's a new feature for limiting processing for power saving, which actually limit the processing power for system interrupts and other important processes!!

  Here's how to stop it.
