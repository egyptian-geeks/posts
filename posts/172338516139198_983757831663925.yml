      Fady Anwar Torrents avoid that using hashes to verify the data, the torrent file is actually a list of trackers and hashes (similar thing with magnet links), to break this you'll need two cause to values to give the same hash, it should be extremely hard to do that, if it isn't then the hashing algorithm is weak (eg: MD5 is known to be weak).
      I'm sure Microsoft did something similar, probably also sending these hashes from their servers signed by a specific certificate so nobody else can impersonate them and send different hashes :)

    message: Hassan Aly Selim two words.. hash collisions! Because of the limited
      nature of the MD5 hash output length and the infinite possibilities of data
      that can be hashed, one can possibly (very luckily) find a hash collision between
      a critical windows file and  a his backdoor code that have some garbage data
      inserted to generate the same hash using rainbow tables for instance, if not,
      at least will be able to replace the critical file with some corrupted one,
      contaminate the pool and cause havoc, I.e. DOS which might be already happening
      and causing the strange error messages people are getting.. even on local networks,
      it's very hard to secure such adhoc networks.

      Yes theoretically, but probability of collision in good Algorithms is almost impossible to craft a collision, if it was practical on any level you would have seen it happen in stuff like Bitcoin for example which is basically built on it, also any electronic signature is effectively a hash function.
      However we are here talking about having with no keys, once you add a key it is a different story, for example bcrypt which is typically used with passwords

      There is nothing new here, you could still do this theoretical attack on any updates delivered online with a man in the middle, it is a known target, and that's why it is secured.
      You can't stop development because you have theoretical attacks, otherwise you won't do anything, you mitigate them.

      Fady Anwar I think there are many people motivated to try to break hashing algorithms (and find collisions) due to how common they are in security systems, but so far I haven't heard of anybody breaking any of the known algorithms except for MD5.
      Whatever hashing system they're using to verify updates, there are tons of other systems that rely on it too, an exploit in the algorithm is bad news for everybody, not just windows updates :D
