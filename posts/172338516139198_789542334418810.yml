    message: I have a lot of legacy with this old computer .. I learned how computers
      work .. and learned assembly language with it .. the thrill to make it faster
      and faster by any possible mean .. I remember the day when articles was saying
      cache the sin function in a lookup table .. in the end its resolution was 265x198
      points .. 16 color only .. and a huge 32kb maximum ram to fill it. yet the games
      on it were endless experience :)

    message: I had an apple IIc to learn basic on. Monochrome display and I can't
      remember how many KB's of RAM. The nostalgia is why I'm collecting every old
      computer that I can find now.
