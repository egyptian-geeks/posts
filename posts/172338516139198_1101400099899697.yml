      httpsify is a https reverse proxy ...
      ---
      [https request] --> httpsify --> [apache/nginx/nodejs/... etc]
      but this isn't the point because there are many https offloaders,
      but httpsify uses letsencrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/)
      for automatically generating free and valid ssl certificates, as well as auto renewal of certs,
      this web server by default uses HTTP/2 .
      ---
      you can say that httpsify is just a http/2 & letsencrypt wrapper for any http web server with no hassle, it just works .

      I've read the code, and it seems that this script listens on port 443, and receives the requests from users, then forwards them to the web server on port 80, gets the response and then pushes that response back to the user encrypted.

      The script uses SSL certificates by Lets Encrypt.

      Lets Encrypt itself is one of the most awesome things that happened lately :D

      Read more about it here:

    message: I'm happy to see more and more Go developers in the group. I was planning
      to start the first Go meetup in Egypt when the Go meetups all over the world
      were celebrating Go 1.6 but I wasn't available that day unfortunately. Why don't
      we start a meetup or a workshop or something ?
