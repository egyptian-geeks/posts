message: "I think this is one of the best \"practical\" IOT course that I've ever
  seen , It starts from scratch then reaching with you to  implement your own IOT
  real products , it's for free BTW :\"D \n\nAnd for those who don't know about esp8266
  you will discover something will change your way of thinking and it will open to
  you many door in the tracks of embedded systems , web development and networking
  \n But for those who used it before, let's forget the old fashioned days \nand the
  AT-commands, here we will flash the ESP8266 directly and will implement our servers
  , client and applications from scratch by our hands not just using already existing
  libraries , so let's have fun guys or i should say geeks :\"D"
