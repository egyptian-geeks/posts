  Hello Every Body,

  I posted the following question, but I haven't received any answer.

  What I am trying to do is to make replication between two processes. where one of them is alive and the other replica is sleeping but a third process keeps coping the state of the first and moving it the second one.

  I am trying to do this in a process agnostic way by strapping both of them from the same script (A simple script as a poc) and copy both the heap and the stack of the process.

  The memory mapping is visible in the /proc/pid/maps with the tags [heap] and [stack] the others are dynamically loaded and shall not be considered.

  The /proc/pid/map_files doesn't even have the links to this pages its only used to map the needed files to memory pages.

  Thanks in advance
