    message: Think of an array as reference type, similar to C# for example, or any
      language that has pointers. array is copied by reference. All line 68 did was
      copying the reference to the same array in memory to a new array reference variable,
      which refers to the same array in memory.

    message: If you want to make another copy of the array, the actual steps (which
      can be wrapped in single method call) is to create a new array with the same
      size and make each position refer to the same object (or copy of it, if value
      type, like most primitives, or string, as special case).

      So it's like creating a "variable "containing the original array, any methods applied to it would affect the original array in the "variable", right?

      This doesn't happen in ruby, right? When applying methods to arrays it created a new array with the result but doesn't affect the original, correct?

    message: Applying methods to arrays depends on each method. Some might return
      new array, some might change array and return nothing or return the changed
      array. In line 68, you are just making a copy of the reference that points to
      this array (and used to call its methods and access it in any way), not calling
      a method on it.

    message: so changing this reference/variable would affect the array, that's what
      I meant..sorry..
