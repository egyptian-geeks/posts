  Hey Guys,

  So bringing you some stuff from the chrome dev summit. Google is pushing for PWA and many companies are adapting it really fast! last year it was Flipkart this year there are new players:
  1. housing.com
  2. m.alibaba.com
  3. cnet.com/tech-today
  4. https://mobile-beta.westelm.com/

  they also released a chrome extension to help you see where you are with PWA: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk

  For emerging markets if you are seeing a weird behaviour (as us) when users install and uninstall your app 3-4 times a month i think the best way is PWA which doesn’t take much space with the add to home screen feature.

  Some numbers has been shared as well:

  1. Alibaba has seen 75% higher conversion on their mobile site after releasing their PWA.
  2. Alibaba users re-engaging 4x more often with site added to home screen.
  4. Prompting users sooner yields 48% more installs.
  5. 53% of users abandon sites that takes longer than *3 seconds* to load on a 3G network
  6. 18 Billion Push notifications sent daily and 50,000 domains using push.

  *Seamless Sign-in*

  AliExpress:
  -85% sign-in failure.
  +11% conversion

  Pinterest:
  +10% increase in desktop logins

  Hope this can help you find your way in anything new you are working on.
