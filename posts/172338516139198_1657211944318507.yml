      I just want to add my 2 cents for the failure preparation

       - Make sure you have a retry strategy in place, so when one of your services fails to respond, you call it again. One approach is to you use exponential backoff with jitter. The idea behind exponential backoff, is to use progressively longer waits between retries, and the idea behind jitter, is to add additional random wait, in order to avoid calling the same service from all instances at the same time, which may potentially kill your service before recovering.

       - Make sure you have proper fallbacks in place. What if stock service for instance is not responding, can you assume the product is in stock and proceed? What if you depend on configuration files stored in s3 bucket, and, yes, you guessed it right, s3 is down at least in your region, do you have local configuration files? …etc

       - Make sure to wrap your services in a circuit-breaker. If at some point, your service keeps failing and returning 5xx for instance, it doesn’t make sense to keep calling it, rather you should fail fast and execute the fallback, if you have one.

      I must say retry mechanism is great, but it comes with a price, if you have 15 instances of one service calling another service, it means when you do one retry, you have doubled the amount of requests expected for that service. So, make sure you keep it in mind while planning your capacity.
