      Very easy in most cases ...
      Web-based normally use web browser, it is easy to find the popular rotating loading animation in center of the screen, web fonts or web-pages, web-rendering to the page, web controls ( drop-down etc ), Web Apps normally doesn't have this smooth animation the native have and even if they did, you will experience some delay and flickers.

      Native apps, are always faster, their chrome controls are a little unique, not all of them can be done easily in web-apps, native animations are too smooth without flickers or glitches, response time is even faster, .

      trick: go to device settings -> developer options -> show layout boundries.  if
      it is native, there will be boxes on every view. if it is web, there will be
      one big box on webview. waiting a chocolate for this trick :)'
