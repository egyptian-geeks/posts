  question regarding internet speed, i never get the full speed unless i'm on youtube or direct downloading with IDM, anything other than that it seems as if it's throttling, i looked everywhere but all results was just checking for DNS and flush it, but doesn't work, any clue about such issue would be appreciated. as you can see installing new Ubuntu packages used only 1/4 of the speed and this happens with so many streams and websites and also includs npm

  PS: it does exist before yesterday internet issue, i also contacted the tech support and it was the usual answer " i checked the line and there is no problem "

    message: I would recommend you do all your testing on wired LAN. WiFi will always
      have more latency that might affect your test. Just a thought.

    message: "Maybe because IDM and YouTube use multiple simultaneous connections
      so that's why you are only getting the maximum speed with them. \nI believe
      I had this problem once (my ISP is Etisalat ADSL) and I called their technical
      support and actually one of their engineers called me back (and he was in complete
      understanding of all the technical terms I used) and then they did something
      on their end and the problem was solved."

    message: I see also you are using a virtual environment with maxed-out RAM. Can
      you try in the host OS with a normal RAM usage just to isolate any possible
      throttling due to excessive use of paging on a slow drive?
