  Ideas?

  Context:

  My client uses AbcPdf (so, thanks, but it's unlikely to move to something else now). I'm running a thing on Windows 10, and according to Docs, the version I use (AbcPDF 9) supports IE11.

  But some styles (only few of them) are not applied. I could spot a case where things like ":not(.some-class)" isn't working, although it's working in normal page when opened in IE11.

  I looked for options, saw Selectivizr, but it seems to do nothing (I think I load it correctly, after jQuery and styles).

  My assumption is that AbcPdf is working in some earlier IE mode or something. Is there any other option that adds the ":not()" etc selectors to earlier IE?

  Or maybe, is there any way I can make sure AbcPDF is using the full capabilities of IE11 installed?

  Thanks.

      I'm not sure if this is useful in your case or not, but I know that to make sure IE11 uses all it's supported features, you put this in the head:
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />

    message: I just confirmed that it renders as IE 9 (printed the classes in the
      conditional comments around the HTML tags), which is crazy because it's running
      on a Windows 10 machine that only has IE11.
