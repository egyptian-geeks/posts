  issues, security issues, and stability issues with MongoDB yet somehow it''s still
  the go-to NoSQL data store, the most popular one. Why is that?'

    message: Those "MongoDB disasters" are mainly the result of incompetence rather
      than a fault in the product itself. Some might argue that the insecure default
      config of MongoDB is a mark of a faulty product, yet others might argue that
      this is actually an advantage that allows quick prototyping.
