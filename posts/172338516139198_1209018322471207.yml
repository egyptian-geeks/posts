      knowledge belongs to the all knower not the one who discovered it.

      Science is property for all humanity *if* the publisher (or author) agreed to share the science. Otherwise, this is a theft.
      As a researcher, I understand the problem here, but this doesn't give me the right to violate others' rights.
      Open access science attempts to solve this problem legally, and it has been gaining popularity for years now...

    message: The idea that science or knowledge is owned is a lie that is being propagated
      by corporations in my opinion, knowledge was always free and people were always
      free to acquire it until companies started hiding it for profit. All software,
      scientific knowledge, algorithms, and software should be free and same goes
      for art too. If the artist or science doesn't want to do it for the sake of
      art or science then we are better off when they stip

    message: "Maybe I'm biased (and not that much of an expert on the subject so correct
      me if I'm wrong), but I don't think it's the same as cracking software, or leaking
      books, though it's still not completely morally okay. I agree with the concept
      that knowledge should not be hidden or exclusive, the process of getting access
      to some papers is ridiculous, and publishing in open access journals is costly
      for the author, but there is always The Other Side and all that. \n\nThat being
      said, for the system to change, even on a small scale, this would have to happen.
      Unless someone has better suggestions?"

      ok so you say knowledge is free right?
      ok, now let's talk about discovering new things, is it free? no, you actually pay time or money or both (eg: scientific research). So why would you give away your findings for free when it cost you so much?
      You didn't get that new knowledge directly from the creator of the universe for free (you're not a prophet), you spent countless hours and without you sharing your new knowledge others would have to spend that time to acquire that new knowledge and they might not be as lucky as you.

      Another aspect, you say source code is conceptually free right?
      But that code wouldn't exist without the knowledge and experience of its authors (developers) who have spent a lot of time and/or money to gain that experience. If it was free, then an animal or an inanimate object could've written it, as long as a human was required to write it and that human has spend time or money or energy to create that output then it is not technically "free".

      Of course sharing your knowledge and experience for free is a great thing, and that's how humanity can become better and reach new levels, and it's something that religions encourage for that reason. But doing so isn't the "natural thing", it's more like a "sacrifice" you do for the sake of everybody else.
