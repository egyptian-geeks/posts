      Check the "Offline Work", Hopefully it will speed up your build drastically.
      That will stop gradle from updating the libraries from upstream each time you hit the run button.

      try gradle plugin 1.4.0-betax , it's much faster
      although your RAM is too low for Android development, you should upgrade it
