message: "I have had a test in an interview. \nIt was about modern C++. \nIt included
  questions about smart pointers, locks , decltype, auto , move & move assignment
  constructors..\n\nI don't know a lot about modern C++ and I feel a little lost between
  all resources I found, so If anyone knows a good resource , I will be thankful .\n\nAlso,
  is there companies in Egypt utilize this modern C++ ?"
