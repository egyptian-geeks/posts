message: "Hello everyone\nThere is a problem in our business model and we are trying
  to solve it and i would appreciate opinions\n \nFor every user he is allowed to
  use under his account up to 4 devices ( we deliver premium content and we want to
  limit access ) , in the past we used to use device id (ios & Android ) and now to
  Access such information we need to explicitly ask for phone permission on Android
  6.0+. And we want to use something else that is less scary and keeps the user privacy
  yet unique per device. \nI've thought of instance ID , GUID but I'm not sure if
  there is a better solution and which to choose"

    message: "From my point of view all these can be spoofed , note that something
      like Knox , BlueStacks (Android on PC) tools can be a huge pain that way , \nSo
      my proposed solution would be a device authentication and limit the number of
      sessions to 4 per user if you need to enable them to switch devices , however
      if it is restricted to have 4 devices in a lifetime generate a hash and save
      it encrypted in the device in a safe way so that no one can spoof it"
