  I'm doing #mentoring and mock up interviews on Skype, so everyday I will post an interview question, and I hope I get Answers, First few questions are
  For Embedded Engineers
  Compare the following function and macro definitions. What is the difference
  between them? In what cases is the behavior different?
  int sum(int val) { return val+val; }
  #define sum(val) (val+val)
  Assume you have a variable p:
  int *p = (int*)0x0A000000;
  what is the value of p+10 and why?
