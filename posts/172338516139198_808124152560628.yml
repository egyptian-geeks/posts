    message: Interesting. I always thought a console-based editor would be nice, but
      being a dark matter developer I was always scared by the vim and brothers crap.
      Good to see people ae moving this in some good direction, although the "yet
      another sublime clones" is silly I agree.

    message: You sometimes can't avoid the console and if you're not a vim person
      it's gonna be a real pain. I like that the dev just took something everyone
      finds useful and made it available in a new useful way. This is not a clone,
      this is what we should call incremental progress.

    message: In my enterprisy work I don't need to edit files in the console. I almost
      never touch the production environment except with log viewer tools, etc. anyway.
      The deployment and changes are always done via CI. When I'm working locally
      from the console (PowerShell most often), it's very easy to run sublime on a
      particular file or even explorer on current folder
