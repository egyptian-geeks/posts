  few years ago, I was hired to work as a consultant on a software project for a large
  French tech company. What I have witnessed there is beyond everything I could possibly

  of professional competence was the utmost contempt for human dignity which at some
  point made me compare the whole experience to (what I imagine can be) jail. \"\n\nEnjoy.
