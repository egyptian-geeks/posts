      Someone on this planet was lucky because I didn't know where he/she lives :D
      (and I'm not just saying badly-written code, I'm talking about a WPF application made without using databinding nor templates, and connects to an Access DB with unnecessary normalization! The code turned me into a violent psychopath :D)

      WPF (or any other XAML-based platform) can actually be very elegant, I rewrote the whole thing, I made great use of the MVVM pattern and XAML templates and styles, then I slightly de-normalized the DB and actually turned it into an XML  file (it was very small and doesn't change in runtime, more like config than a DB), the result was very beautiful code :)
      and BTW in my case, WPF merged with MonoGame (XNA) was a much better solution that trying to do the UI in MonoGame which doesn't have any UI components so I would've had to reinvent buttons and layout systems!
