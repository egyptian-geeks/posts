  I need a good Arabic morphology API.
  What I need exactly is to input an Arabic word, and the result would be if this word a verb or a noun or if it's a dual or a single  ... etc.
  I'm not looking to do anything from the start, I need an API to do this, or at least help me to reach this.
  I found a lot of tools when I search, but I'm not sure which ones are good, anyone tried anything related to this before?

      did you tried WordNet ? https://wordnet.princeton.edu/
      there is a section for other languages in the menu (Arabic included), as i remember one of my friends did some thing like that with their Python NLTK Interface in the NLP course.
