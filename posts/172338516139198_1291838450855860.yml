message: "Dear Geeks,\n\nSerious question:\n\nIf you had to describe the perfect company/job
  for you, what would be the following:\n\n1. Benefits (Insurance, allowances ...etc)\n2.
  Type of work in one sentence\n3. Dev environment\n4. What other perks?\n\nAlso,
  \nHow many hours a day of sustained (something you can do day after day, month after
  month on a regular basis) concentrated work can you do?, leaving out coffee/prayer
  breaks etc.\n\nPlease make your answer in the above format and just write your years
  of experience at the top of the comment as a general gauge.\n\nThe idea is to get
  a general idea of what devs in Egypt really need to be comfortable yet productive
  and reliable."

    message: So the guys who answered so far have been depressing and disappointing,
      if you guys answer that way in an interview, good luck getting hired. I see
      no imagination, creativity, even dreams. Guys, I am asking a simple question
      and I gave you the format for the answer and an example, if you can't do that,
      how do you do any creative programming?
