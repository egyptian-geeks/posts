    message: I work with one of the biggest Agile advocates in Australia. I see the
      internal conversations that happen, and the agendas that are not necessarily
      shared with everyone else. And I tell you, all this thing about people doing
      this only for more billable hours and such is simply BS (yes, that's Bullshit).
      If this Zen guy has a problem with some people trying to game the system to
      their advantage, it doesn't mean that the system is made for those people's
      advantage. C'mon!

    message: well, it's stated as a software development problem, I mean the lack
      of understanding and lack of communication between manager and clients at one
      side and programmers at the other side.

    message: Looking at "They Really Value" column, this is about bad intentions not
      bad communication. Don't hire bastards to build your software and then blame
      the process.

    message: Regarding the educational material and stuff (Wow, look at t-shirts,
      tell me guys when you buy one, you get a new title with it, well deserved!),
      see my first comment, not from an Arab or conservative source, but Pluralsight,
      I assume you know them.
