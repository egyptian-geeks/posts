message: "Hi, \nI have a question regarding databases and controlling data display.
  \"I have searched in vain as I cant find the keyword describing this issue\"\n\nhere
  is the case,\n\nIn practical, when querying a database ( possibility a large scale
  one ), results cant be displayed entirely at once ( because of large data/internet
  limitations/unnecessary extra data/etc). \n\nSo, it should be divided into parts
  just like the Facebook news feed or google search results. then more data can be
  retrieved and displayed by making more requests.\n\nThe question is how to keep
  track of the results set ?,\n\nfor example, a server query a table with 1024 products
  and sort them according to user's preferences (preferences differ from a user to
  another). \n\nThe 1024's data cant be displayed at once so i have to divide them
  say in 10s. if I send 10 products to the user how can I keep track of the result
  set when user requests more products ? do I have to query again ?\n\n- more examples:
  displaying Facebook friends, people you may know etc\n\nIs there any keyword or
  topic describing this ??\n\n- I'm working with php, mysql and android.\n\nThx, in
  advance."

    message: It's called "pagination". It depends on your database implementation,
      in MySQL for instance you need to use OFFSET and LIMIT in the select statement.
      And yes, you need to make a new request when you need more data that would do
      a new DB query.

      in SQL Server, you can use OFFSET with SELECT and ORDERBY, but it is not guaranteed to optimize the query speed.

      if you are also looking for speed, I would recommend looking into #clustered_index, if you write your queries right, a where condition could cut the table scan time greatly, and provide the pagination you need: WHERE id > 50 AND Id < 100
