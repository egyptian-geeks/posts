    message: Overall, both these frameworks are good to use as per your requirements.
      CakePHP is suitable for developers new to MVC and those who require stricter
      conventions. ZF is a choice for those who need better control over the application
      design and built-in support for renowned Web services. Both the frameworks are
      developing fast and the choice is entirely yours.
