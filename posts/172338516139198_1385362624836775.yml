  Android users... what is your experience in running after-market ROMs/kernels?

  That is if you don't own a Nexus/Pixel, of course!

  Personally I have always been a fan of AOSP-like ROMs (CyanogenMod, later LineageOS), always hated the ugly skin on top of Android that ships with the likes of Samsung, Sony, Huawei, etc. Yes, sometimes you lose a feature here or there, but at the end you have much more flexibility, and usually smoother and faster experiences, not to mention faster updates to the latest versions of Android months before the official manufacturer releases, if it ever happens!

  My last trial was with my brand new Samsung S7 Edge, after a couple of weeks of hesitation because of the Knox warranty bit and losing of Samsung Pay and all the consequences of flashing un-official software... I bit the bullet and flashed the latest LinageOS 14.1 experimental builds on it... it is not perfect, the camera needs improvement and few audio bugs, but other than that, a very noticeable difference in speed and experience of the very latest "almost" vanilla Android.

  Interested to hear your opinions and experiences!

    message: "My phone (oneplus one) is actually built from the start on top of Cyanogen,
      so I totally understand that feeling of getting the latest Android bug fixes
      and new versions before the majority, and also to get some neat features that
      gives you an edge over most of the other phones out there. \nCurrently I'm planning
      to install LineageOS and see how the phone will perform."

    message: I used Omni ROM on my old Galaxy note II, uses half the RAM and consumes
      half the power that the original ROM. It worked well for about a year then became
      slow and they stopped releasing updates after 4.4 so I switched to nexus 6p.
