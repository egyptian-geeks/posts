    message: The default templating engine in Knockout has some perofmrnace issues
      yeah (but that's pluggable/replaceable), as well as, like everything else, you
      can shoot yourself in the foot with it (too many updates to UI etc, many things
      that are already addressed and have solutions, but those who don't know, don't
      use them).

    message: Also, knockout is the best in terms of browser compatibility. Which is
      important for some projects that care about older IE.

      There is no favorite till now. Each one has advantages & disadvantages.

      Knockout: data binding
      Backbone: routers, Local storage & remote storage

      I'm reading also about Angular & Ember. There are many others but they are not popular the the 4 I mentioned. Beside this, all of these frameworks have plugins, which I should take into considerations.

      One day I will publish a comparison between these frameworks.
