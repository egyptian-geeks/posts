    message: "My problem with most Golang web frameworks is that they're always fighting
      the language. Constantly under this gridlock of trying to port a framework from
      another language while retaining most of its inherent features. Most of which
      are attributed to the implementation language. \nI suppose that's why I've personally
      mostly elected to go for net/http to carry out most of my work.\nThe boilerplate
      grows exponentially though, until you take the time to extract some common patterns
      from your work into a reusable package."

      The community at large is mostly oriented towards this common patterns methodology than embracing a single source of truth regarding an idiomatic framework.

      Surprisingly though, most gophers are ex-rubyist and python engineers. I've always been baffled at that thought.
      I reckon it's how the core team have mostly influenced and positioned the language.

      For instance, core ruby does afterall, embrace rails as the defacto standard to web development in ruby.
