    message: I'd say do well in the interviews so that you're in a position of power.
      Also read the contract carefully and if you can pass it to a lawyer. Ask about
      benefits, health care, insurance, taxes, vacations etc.

      1- Negotiations need leverage, means that you need to have options so you can comfortably ask for something and be willing to walk away if you didn't get a satisfying package
      2- Your negotiation already started even before getting the offer, from the point you were approached by a recruiter or a hiring manager, most probably they asked for your expected compensation or current compensation, usually you avoid answering this question early on, dodge it like a bullet, it is not in your best interest to give any information at this point where you have the least leverage.
      3- Shop around, get multiple offers if possible, also ask around within your network to see what is an expected package for this role.
      4- Understand the offer presented very well, most probably especially in well established companies the overall compensation package is more than just the salary, see what you care the most about and make sure it meets your expectations
      5- Again, be ready to walk away from the negotiations if you didn't like what you're getting, don't look or sound desperate or willing to work anyway and just trying to negotiate for the sake of trying.
      6- Have a number in mind that you consider a Red-Line -after doing enough research- so whenever a company presents something below this number, you refuse without much thinking, the more you take to reply the more you are perceived to be close to accepting, so when you are presented by a number and you reject right away, it is a good indication that this number is not acceptable at all, and they need to do better.
