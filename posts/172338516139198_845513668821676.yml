  This is what IE on Windows Phone sends as user agent ... !!! :)

  We are using a mobile OS detect library, it returned the following after reading the header:
  isAndroid: yes
  isIPhone: yes
  isWindowPhone: no :)

      might be stupid, but i think they have a point because some websites using custom

    message: When I have to do some user agent preferences i prefer to write my on
      validation instead of using a library that has million of user agents to test/match.
      just write your user agent validation it will be much faster and you will guarantee
      the results you want.

    message: I worked on a similar library about 4 years ago, user-agents are not
      fun at all, no consistency whatsoever, especially when you also have to deal
      with Feature phones from China.

      Believe me, the library is the last of our concerns :)
      We eventually made the user agent detection code ourselves.

      I think this is WP8.1 Update 1, they said they made IE work for websites that use iOS-specific features that aren't part of the standards.
