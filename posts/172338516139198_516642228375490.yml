      ofcourse not, but I think the difference is Woooping!!
      to be honest, it's way beyond what I've expected.

      1. Always be very sceptical re: performance comparisons
      2. Most lnockout performance issues come from the embedded jQueryTmpl template. You can always change that to any template you like its performance
      3. Obviously the more you need to do the more time things take. No magic is served here
      4. Read point 1 again, and then see how for example the backbone test appends HTML. this is a) direct HTML setting, which is sure faster than any templating b) is not how things are done in many cases in real world - one of the problems with these tests is always how many optimisations can be done vs. are actually done  "per tested framework" differs from one to another

    message: Like all similar choices, you choose the best set of trade-offs. Which
      frameworks get what you need to get done relatively easy and don't break under
      expected load? Once you answer that, you can favor other things like ease of
      development, performance, etc.
