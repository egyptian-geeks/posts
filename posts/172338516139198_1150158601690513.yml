      From my point of view, Xamarin acquisition and it's lifespan and future promises has nothing to do with Microsoft's failure in mobile OS market.
      Although that currently windows mobile has like 2% of global mobile OS market share, this is not contradicting with the promising future of Xamarin and the way it allows developers to build cross-platform apps targeting iOS, Android and Windows mobile.

      For example, the majority of it has only 1GB RAM, while greater than 1 GB is
      very expensive.'

      The decline of Windows Phone actually means that Xamarin is more important for Microsoft, because it's the tool that allows developers using Microsoft tools to continue using their tools when developing for the other big mobile platforms.

      Microsoft's mobile strategy doesn't only mean Windows Phone. They are investing in Office for Android and iOS a lot (and several other apps) that the decline of Windows Phone was by no means a surprise.

      Similarly to how they invest in supporting Linux to bring their developers to their cloud, they also embrace other mobile OSes for developers to use their development tools and mobile productivity tools even when using other mobile OSes.

    message: Microsoft is losing money ever time it sells a phone, but i think Windows
      Phone platform is not dead, sure it is irrelevant and declining today and Microsoft
      is dealing with this fact by laying off people left and right, but i think they
      may still have long term plan for Windows 10 Phone, Also, on many occasions
      they gave a hint that Windows 10 Phone may be used not only in phones, that
      is why Xamarin is very important for them. But still from a developer prospective
      why would i waste my time developing/migrating new/already existing applications
      if there is no echo system on this platform to be begin with.
