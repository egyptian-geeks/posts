message: 'Currently, the attacker just needs to entice the victim (using fully updated
  Google Chrome and Windows) to visit his web site to be able to proceed and reuse
  victim''s authentication credentials. Even if the victim is not a privileged user
  (for example, an administrator), such vulnerability could pose a significant threat
  to large organisations as it enables the attacker to impersonate members of the

  escalate access and perform attacks on other users or gain access and control of
  IT resources.
