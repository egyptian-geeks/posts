message: "I need to start a \"Code Optimization\" Process in my team , any suggestion
  on how to do ? \n\nP.S. Nothing to do with quality or bugs , just to optimize for
  higher quality.\n\nUpdate 16/4/2016 -----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat
  im talking here about is a process \"steps\" just like the QA process , i don't
  want to learn or read about Code Optimization , i need a practical process to ensure
  the code is  optimized , if someone have something similar in his team/company will
  be fantastic."

      You may start with DRY principle, there is a tool called atomiq will show you whether the system is tightly coupled or not, and where duplicates in code are.

      I hope the tool works for you (didn't start with me last time I tried it) but you may find other tools.

      What do you want to optimize? What kinds of projects do you work on?
      There is a set of practices that work for most kinds of projects:

      * Code Review for every commit
      * Unit tests
      * Continuous Deployment
      * Using static code analyzers (Ex: FindBugs) as a part of the build process and fail the build in case these tools find errors.
      * Doing load tests (If applicable)
      * Having a true senior engineer in the team to help with design reviews and to transfer his knowledge and experience to other team members.
      * Not sacrificing long term maintainability and extensibility (Better designs for example) for short term goals (faster delivery at the cost of bad design and code).
      * Using profilers and having metrics on the performance on your products and continuously monitoring them.

    message: "What do you mean by code optimizations? What are your goals from this
      optimization?\nEvery dimention in software development has its own optimizations.\nFor
      example, do you suffer from bad performance? Do you suffer from maintenance?
      Do you have security concerns..etc?\nI will give you general advice which I
      think will make you life happier:\n- perfect is the enemy of good enough, weigh
      your projects and put your efforts in the best place.\n- not all projects the
      same, and not all parts of the project have the same importance. Again, put
      your best efforts in parts that has the most ROI.\n- avoid plugging patterns
      and technologies in your application for the sake of just using them without
      real need or to put them in your resume. \n- Most of the optimizations you think
      you might need them, actually you will never need them. YAGNI\n- cleverness
      left the road for simplicity, it's hard to read code than to write it. If I
      have to recommend a single development practice, it will be writing clean code(actually,
      there is a book with the same name, clean code, which I think the number 1 must
      read development book)"
