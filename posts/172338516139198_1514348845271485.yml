    message: What i know is that immutable data structure is an architecture for functional
      programming and pure functions pattern, also i read a chapter from the book
      ''ng-book2-angular4'' and the author said that observables with reactive programming
      is kinda the best data architecture you can use and the focus was on that in
      the whole book alongside the usage of redux, therefore I'm still learning angular
      4 and have no certain answer for you but the book is highly recommended since
      it's all about angular 4 with coverage for everything.
