  "We Feel Overwhelmed Working in legacy code is difficult. There is no denying it. Although every situation is different, one thing is going to make the job worth it to you as a programmer or not: figuring out what is in it for you. For some people, it is a paycheck, and there isn’t anything wrong with that—we all have to make a living. But there really ought to be some other reason why you are programming.

  If you were lucky, you started out in this business writing code because you thought it was fun. You sat down with your first computer ecstatic with all of the possibilities, all of the cool things you could do by programming a computer. It was something to learn and something to master, and you thought, “Wow, this is fun. I can make a great career if I get very good at this.”

  Not everyone comes to programming this way, but even for people who didn’t, it is still possible to connect with what is fun about programming. If you can—and some of your coworkers can, too—it really doesn’t matter what kind of system you are working on. You can do neat things with it. The alternative is just dejection. It isn’t any fun, and frankly, we all deserve better than that."
