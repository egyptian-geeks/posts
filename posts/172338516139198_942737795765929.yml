    message: Symfony is the best out there but it still depends upon your project.
      some projects does not need having even too fat frameworks and you may go for
      something like slim.

      ^ Popular does not mean best, specially in the PHP world.

      One obvious example is Wordpress! It sucks on all technical levels, from architecture, to extensibility to utilizing resources to plugin compatibility to separation of concerns, etc. Yet, it is the most used PHP CMS out there!

      WordPress is awesome. When I see all the ecosystems and business that were built on top of it, all the plugins that do everything I need.

      And from being interested in startup and & marketing world, seeing all its enabling non-tech people to do from injecting landing pages to selling stuff to running online courses and much much more...
