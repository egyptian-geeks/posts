  Is contributing to open source project that hard?

  This pull request should be fixing some kind of annoying bugs in webpack but not reviewed till now... I spent much time reading the code and reverse engineering it to break down and maintain and fear the idea I wasted that time

  https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6265

  Can you please tell me what's wrong with it?

    message: i don't think the time spent reading source code would be a waste of
      time if the pull request was not accepted. odds are you learned a lot while
      going through the source code and IMO this is the most important thing you can
      get from contributing to open source.

      Great job, however for more clean PR it's recommended to squash irrelevant commits to your fix/feature and push your PR with minimum number of commits if possible, like in your PR your suggested to squash the following commits:
      - linting and beautifying code
      - beautify code with linter

    message: Why do you have 4 commits for a single bug fix? You added code and then
      deleted it, like dummy() for example. The reviewer doesn't need to see intermediate
      stages. If I may suggest something, it would make the reviewer life easier to
      have a single commit with all the changes.

    message: And it’s not a bug, you are introducing a feature. And it’s not a small
      project, it’s we pack and it’s being used by tons of other open source project
      which mean whoever accept the PR should be 10000% sure it ain’t breaking anything.
      It also should comply with the coding standards being used in that project and
      its direction.
