  What do you favor more in Junior developers: Depth or Breadth?
  Would you prefer hiring an individual with knowledge of every single tool shallowly or an individual that is an expert in only 1(little) tool?

    message: I'd say for a junior, associate and mid senior, a breadth is favored
      over depth. Senior positions are more likely to be fulfilled with someone with
      a certain depth in a number of topics. the more you go up the less topics/depth
      ratio. This is only how I see it and it doesnt have to be right.

    message: and by mid senior I mean someone who isnt leading the dev process but
      yet his chances of getting stuck is a fraction compared to juniors/associates
