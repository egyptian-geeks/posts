      I believe that any time you invest in learning how to make emails *responsive* on mobile is worthless; honestly. Email clients' state is worse than the  browsers. There is a project trying to bring standards to HTML emails but it is not backed up by many vendors nor organization. A massive client like GMail isn't complying with its guidelines even. All the methods published by Litmus or campaign monitor are hacks ... very fragile, very error prone and doesn't work on a number of widely used clients. We are still struggling with basic HTML emails layouts, adding a layer of complexity like responsive design or videos or CSS shapes just doesn't make any sense ...
      This is my opinion that is probably debatable ...
