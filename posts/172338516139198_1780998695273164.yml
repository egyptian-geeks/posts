  hey, I would like switch over We Telecom egypt (TEData previously) ISP to one of Noor ADSL or Vodafone ADSL. I'm gonna dispensed with Tal'a Speed but it stops a lot of other services like VPNs and Tors which is the main reason to get over it and lastly the redirection to mining website (links in the first comment).
  And please if you can specify why you chosen certain one.. and I do care about service persistence & stability.

      I tried NOOR 1.5 years ago for about 2 months,
      The speed is really decent,the service is stable and they have a really good costumer service compared to the others,

      The downside is at that time they blocked voip protocols  completely while tedata still offered it on random time basis-sometimes it worked - so I had to switch back to tedata as voip is a huge priority in my usage
