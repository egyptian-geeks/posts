message: "Very thoughtful article from Jake Wharton \n\nhttp://jakewharton.com/android-needs-a-simulator/\n\nI've
  been thinking about something like this for a while but from another angle. Imagine
  if Android supported hot code reloading like JRebel does for Java EE applications.
  That would hugely boost developer productivity. Having an Android simulator that
  is completely based on the JVM (not Dalvik or ART) makes this possible...\n\nYour
  thoughts...??"

      I heard that Corona is doing this. Corona is a mobile gaming framework using Lua.
