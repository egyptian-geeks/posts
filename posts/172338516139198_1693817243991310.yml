  I wanna ask the google and eCommerce geeks here a question. If you have high bounce rate from organic search, what are the usual suspects here?

  We initially suspected speed and broken links, but all tools we have report loading speed to be fine (~3 sec per page) and we watched a lot of recorded user sessions and all landed on legitimate pages (no 404s and such)

  So what else could be the case?

      One of the things that reduced the bounce rate dramatically for one of my clients was removing the "subscribe / like our page" popups that appeared when you navigated to the website.
      Try to minimize the clutter for users and make your content directly reachable. And regarding the broken links, it is a factor as well, try redirecting them to the most relevant content, and minimize the 404 errors as much as possible.

      The last problem might be a technical glitch, something looks horrible on Android browser or something, do they have anything in common?
      You need also to make sure your site works using Google Caching Proxy (a feature called "Conserve Bandwidth" in Android Chrome) This is a common pitfall for sites that detects location, because the proxy masks the location.

      If they scroll to the bottom in recordings then bounce, show a popup at the end of the page asking "What are you looking for? or did you find what you are looking for?".
      I think Hotjar's Feedback features does something like that

    message: In addition to content and call to action comments; What are your main
      user flows? maybe what you offer to users is gained from the first landing and
      they don't need to browse more? also, maybe your're addressing the wrong targeted
      segment so they are not interested?
