    message: well i have some points as most of the companies already built their
      services based on Java EE it is difficult to migrate all its business to another
      technology... and some times its restrictions from the headquarter security
      department .. and sometimes for marketing stuff as Java is popular as the most
      secure :)

    message: Because it is the most established and battle-tested EE platform (maybe
      not the most modern or agile, but it is definitely a solid choice), and it can
      request support from their 15-years and 20-years Java consultants anytime from
      HQ.

      Why would any established company trade Java for anything else? Take a look at the TIOBE index and see for yourself. Java is 5 times more popular than its nearest competitor:

      PHP has a bad reputation both as a language, and also for security of the platform (not arguing how correct that is, just arguing that it's known for it).

      NodeJS also has several issues inherited from JavaScript. However it is "starting" to gain traction on big companies due to the microservices  evolution, but mostly in media / social public companies not pure backend applications.

      languages? ??"

    message: Java has amazing frameworks that have been tested and proven in an enterprise
      environment. Spring MVC is an amazing platform for web applications, Hibernate
      for ORM, not to mention all the dependency injection concepts and IOC and AOP
      implemented in the amazing Spring framework. Also, most of the programming world
      still speaks Java and you can deploy your work to any Server, Linux, Unix, Windows,
      even Raspberry Pi. MS is barely catching up.

    message: Node works, bit it is primitive it is good for those who do Javascript
      and want to write server side code, but with all the power of Java and Spring,
      I don't know why you'd bother. PHP feels like you're righting legacy code right
      off the bat and I have seen nothing comparable to Java in terms of frameworks
      for DI, AOP, IOC.
