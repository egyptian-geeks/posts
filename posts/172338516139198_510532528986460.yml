      it's really incredible how the mobile industry is incorporating technologies that the desktop side was crawling for them for years in just few months.
      for example, this 8 core processor was a out of reach for the desktop computers for years. but now, it could be the one to power a mobile phone in your pocket with much much increased power efficiency comparing to it's desktop version.

      till today, the rumors around the upcoming Galaxy S4 are:
      1- a 5.0 inches screen with full HD resolution (1920 x 1080).
      2- the screen will have 441 ppi pixel density (this is by far more than the Apple's Retina display)
      3- 2 GB ram.
      4- 14MB camera that shoots 1080@30 FPS videos

      5- 3awzeen eeh tani, begad 7aram elli bye7sal dah :D

    message: 'Mohammed Hossam: this is correct, but don''t forget that ARM processors
      are not intended to compete with x32 processors. so for their purpose, they
      are extremely powerful and energy-efficient.'
