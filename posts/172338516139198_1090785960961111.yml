  Hi,

  I use Pocket (https://getpocket.com/) a lot, and I really like it. Especially the listen-to-article feature on Android. I was wondering if there is something as good as it on chrome or any browser?

  I tried (SpeakIt!) but it is not good.

  "It also pronounces words with apostrophes as separate units. Ex: "John's car" is pronounced as John? S car. Did I mention that some voices just randomly pause during a speech? Ugh."
