    message: As said in other comments, sockets are better but you'll need a workaround
      for old browser. I wouldn't worry myself about the details and would use a framework
      that encapsulates this for me. For every server framework there's at least one
      option, like SignalR in .NET, socket.io for Node, etc.

      i've tried websockets using socket.io it has no problem with old browsers (as i may remeber it's now supports firefox old versions) also this is not the problem. i'm just asking about performance wise and the concept itself. i've an argument with a friend of mine about it, he was talking about the cost of the opened socket with the browser. but does this cost really matter?!
      and which has the lowest cost having a socket or the ajax long polling?!

      If what you are after is a good argument / case "for" websockets, check:

      My understanding is that Twitter streaming API uses websockets as well, although they don't use the term in their documentation but it's present in a few questions about it.

    message: "I've been researching this issue as well lately. Here is what I learnt\n\n1.
      WebSockets is the most efficient, but it's not supported in all browsers. See
      http://caniuse.com/#search=websockets\n\n2. Long polling is less efficient than
      websockets, because you're still using HTTP with all its overhead. \n\n3. There
      are other techniques to get server notifications, depending on the browser &
      server.\n\n4. There are different tools to abstract these techniques. They use
      the most suitable technique for your browser. They also require support from
      your server software. Examples: SignalR (.net only AFAIK), Socket.io (mainly
      NodeJS, but supported on different server-side stacks) & SockJS (similar in
      purpose to socket.io)\n\n5. There are products which allows you to send server
      notifications without installing anything extra on your server stack. Examples:
      Firebase & Pusher.\n\nThis is not comprehensive. There are many things that
      I heard about but didn't have enough time to investigate: TogetherJS, WebRTC,
      Faye, Google Drive Real-time. The list is very looooooooooong"

      As Meligy mentioned the best solution is to open a Socket and receive your stuff
      throw the socket this way you will have more control to close the socket and
      for concurrency you have a big advantage with socket instead of blocking the
      server process.

      It's much more easier to scale a sockets server, amongst some of the limitations you'll face configuring a server for that is your box's maximum file descriptors which is set to 1024 by default. Linux always requires a lot of tuning for smooth scaling.
      Try to scale a comet server and I'll truly wish you the best of luck with that.. Luck is needed for such task. Http handshakes are expensive and long-living connections are memory hungry.

      Also the model never was intended for such task, http is a hit and run protocol, stateless.
      Server sent events are interesting as well but they're not bidirectional.

    message: "Nop, you won't sockets are very light and you will have the advantage
      of having 2800 concurrent socket open before your sockets start to drops. also
      with socket.io if the socket drop alone it will retry if not if will close automatically,
