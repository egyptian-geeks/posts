    message: Maybe you have to check the php.ini configuration also I prefer hat you
      import the database manually not using phpmyadmin. Plz also consider checking
      the log files of phpmyadmin for further debugging

      1. Determine the php.ini that your server use. checkout the output of phpinfo().
      2. In php.ini set upload_max_filesize to size cover your dump's size in MB. Mine is 250M Also insure that post_max_size is greater than upload_max_size.
      3. Restart your server and retry.
