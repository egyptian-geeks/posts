      فكرة إننا نقعد في البيت لأن في روبوتات هتحل مكاننا ممكن تحصل لغاية حد معين ، بعد كده الانتاج بتاع الروبوتات ده هيفقد معناه لأن أغلب البشر هيبقوا عاطلين و معندهمش رفاهية شراء منتجات تتجاوز الأكل و الشرب والثورة هتتركز في أيدي قلة قليلة من البشر ، وده ربما يؤدي لانهيار النظام الاقتصادي و نشوء نظام تاني.

      مجرد فكرة شاردة

      It's still a very long time before the idea of robots being able to do everything would be practical. Probably not even in our life time.

      For example, for a self-driving car to replace regular cars, the most practical solution of this time is for all cars to be self-driving so they could be all connected to a backend that can synchronize their movements otherwise, they would be always used in limited locations (i.e. can they be used in Egypt or India? or what if while it's driving it went into a scenario that it was never programmed for?)

      The idea of linking all self driving cars to a single backend is so limiting. Google self driving car has already driven 200K+ miles with only two minor accidents. All that is needed is a systematic environment.

      This of course kills the possibility of using such solutions in a chaotic environment like Egypt or India. But, chaotic environments are beyond the scope of such technologies anyhow; people living there are completely safe from this high-end threat, since they are still succumbing to low-end ones.

      $250,000-$300,000 worth of equipment + the base car price. For this to reach
      consumers, the price needs to go way down. which with the current technology,
      is far from practical (that also ignoring the fact that google tests are still
      not wide enough to work in all conditions, i.e. when it's snowy and there are
      accidents and several self-driving cars which went out of their lanes)

      We can make things that are better than us at labor or computation or even make something with better social intelligence, but we can't create something that is better than us in creation!
      I don't think we will ever be able to create something that is more creative than us, because that means that this creation will be able to create things that are even more creative than it. Basically we're talking about software/robots ruling the world and enslaving us :D (if it's truly smarter than us, that it would trick us into doing things!)

      So what I want to say is, when software/robots replace humans, all jobs will have something to do with creating and/or maintaining the software/robots this field will be very big with a lot of specialties and there will be companies competing, so there will still be a lot jobs, they would just be of a completely different kind :)
