      Alaa Attya Mohamed The project idea is great, but since you need contribution to this project I could help as I have very good experience in PHP & Linux sys admin

      but when I browse your project I only see single php file which could be adjustable to run from cli. but the problem if I contribute with new another file for predefined automated function to help sys admin, this mean by end of years you may got like 10-20 helper files and all are separates files which need the sys admin memorize each file features and etc ...

      don't you need to build something first to centralized all future contribution ? like 1 single bash script to with help commands to run all these scripts ? also you may need php installer script to install php for servers which hasn't php installed.

      Just try to put a roadmap for your project, and maybe we start creates new issues with features needed according to your roadmap and then I will be the first one ready to contribute on your project
