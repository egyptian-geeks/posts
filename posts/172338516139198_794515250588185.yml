message: "Any recommendation for a lightweight responsive design CSS framework? \n\nSo
  far the ones I found that are promising.\n1- PureCSS\n2- Skeleton\n\nA little bit
  of background, I am trying to add some mobile friendliness to some existing web
  pages, the web app is pretty complex that rewriting it with a full blown framework
  like bootstrap is unrealistic, especially that mobile support is only needed in
  one or two pages."

      I would recommend you try to apply the media queries yourself.. If not then try a responsive grid system only.. If not then I would recommend Pure. I didn't use it before but i've alwayes liked it
      And in all cases I will be more than happy to help :)
