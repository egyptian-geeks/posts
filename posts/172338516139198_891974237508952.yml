    message: Is it free? I doubt it as Telerik tools have always been super duper
      expensive :v

    message: Xamarin is not that too affordable thing also, they will open source
      NativeScript Framework, and if NativeScript will be part of Telerik platform
      you can get it at $40-$50 monthly, which is more affordable than Xamarin which
      you need three licences regularly to cover Android, IOS and Windows

    message: Damn, oh well no one said software development is cheap, it's just that
      I have been spoiled by Microsoft and the free copies of Visual Studio that I
      used to get from my DreamSpark account :D

    message: Guys, just go open source and forget about the word license, Also expect
      Ubuntu for phones to come out and you can develop on that using Python. I predict
      very soon we won't need these web tools to work on native paltforms.

      their technology stack as open source, but trying hard to connect you to some
      cloud services they do, to find something they can charge you for :)"

    message: But in the end, the open source  world will always have free alternatives
      and with Python libraries will always exist. I predict a world free of big corp
      or more accurately where big corp will have no more control. They will produce
      some nice to haves, but that's it.
