    message: I kind of assumed that the data would be more spread out at the outer
      circles, after all, people talk about "sectors" on a disk, and in geometry sectors
      are arks on a circle defined by their angle (not length), so this is why I made
      that assumption. Apparently I was wrong :D

    message: Putting data in the same partition as the OS will cause fragmentation,
      which will considerably increase disk read time

    message: The instructor explained this concept in the  introduction to PC course
      and the students complained that he was wasting their time with useless information
      :) I guess I could say that I was hurt more by ignorant people than I was ever
      hurt by evil ones. In fact, evil ones could do good things sometimes, but the
      ignorant, they are like Zombies infected with a virus, they are like the undead
      :)
