  Hello Geeks, Almost all of us in the Software Development industry have been hit by a client request to make an Uber for X project. I got over 10 requests now for that type of projects.

  From a decision maker perspective I found that to achieve this project in a proper professional way we have to build it from scratch, and sure this will cost a lot of time and money. (that's a lot for the client to take).

  So, Am sure that 100's of you faced the same request but with different flavors, Then did anyone of you worked on a similar project that are welling do a rebuilt copy or maybe a white label and re-sell it to another client?

  If not, Anyone Interested in building this project and put it here for re-use against a decent fees (sure it will be much less to customize over to build it from scratch again).

  I did checked all the Indian options available in the market, but for sure this option is not on the table and I will not gonna talk about the Indian software :)

  Thoughts?

      By Uber for X, you mean a "Sharing Economy" platform?
      or a more specific "Transportation Management" platform?

    message: "Michael Henry Check out our product Worc , we are packing twice as much
      technology in it than uber, and we know because we were hit by a request for
      an actual uber. Worc is for everybody looking to have an uber, we give people
      pro-bono partners dashboards if they are businesses. and we support unlimited
      categories. We are ready to white label it, but why need a white label in the
      first place ? \nIts a cultural and structural problem in the market, and if
      that thing is built ( which we already built it ) you will still find people
      convinced that they can cover Cairo in its entirety by hiring 5 people and giving
      them a uniform to act as an \"on demand\" app. All operations and supply chain
      theories disregard that hypothesis and they are all going to terribly fail both
      theoretically and on the ground. if you guys are interested, I can create a
      quick game theory analysis as a case study  for all of us. As for your project,
      gimme a call and we can arrange something. \n\nCheers\nWissam Saleh\nwww.worcbox.com"
