message: "Anyone have a good read for typography in web & mobile apps ?\nI'm no designer,
  but I know there must be some strict rules out there like, never go below X font-size
  for readibility or preferred size for headers vs body text.\nI review a lot of designs
  lately and I'm concerned that some designs although look g√≤od as psd. it may not
  be very practical in real life; like font is too big in case title was longer than
  expected  (especially with components that show user entered text). But I don't
  hv scientific ground or numbers to enforce. \nDensity and scaling font is another
  topic I'm aware of; but all my knowledge from trial & error. \nHow do you judge
  on typography?"
