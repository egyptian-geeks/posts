      I tried reading it several times but the sentence doesn't make any sense. Which support will be removed on Jan 2017? There is no official statments from bower. All the links I can found are kinda speculations linking to an old comments thread on github (https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1748#issuecomment-150104311) ITPharaohs website doesn't say they are contributing by  any mean to the open source community and they are remove their *packages* bower.
      I would like to hear your point
