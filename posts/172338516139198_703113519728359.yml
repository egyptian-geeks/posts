  My graduation project was about reverse-engineering C++. At that time, there was no reusable & flexible C++ parser. Today, libclang solves this problem. This example uses the Python binding to parse & generate C++

      The problem he's mentioning is a commonly known issue with C++ language design, in a nutshell the parsing output of c++ grammar is undecidable. There is a lot of discussion back and forth about its grammar. Some claim it's context-free, some say it's context-sensitive and ambiguous.

      Back in the days, a good C or C++ parser was a luxury (parsing C++ is notoriously complex than parsing C too). So clearly, Mohammad Tayseer's graduation project was to unravel C++ parsing. Pretty kick ass for a graduation project, he just used the term reverse-engineering for context that's all and his work might have actually been reverse engineering by a book's definition.

      Today we have the luxury of parser generator technology, compiler constructor toolsets and an increasing number of openly available grammars of mainstream languages. Back then, you were on your own.

      Khaled M. Diab Forward-engineering is going from high-level to low-level (Design to code, or code to binary). Reverse-engineering is going from low-level to high-level. My project is about reading C++ & generating class diagrams & call stack

      Hady Ahmed I'm flattered, but my project was not about parsing C++ itself. We used an open-source C++ parser called OpenC++. It was easy to use, but it could parse only a subset of C++ standard. GCC is not reusable at all. Other options were not easy to use, or very expensive (e.g. PVS studio is sold today for €5250) http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0217/

    message: "I believe that reverse-engineering is trying to understand a black box
      (which its internal is totally hidden), and come up with a model on how this
      box works. I still can't relate this concept to generating class diagrams or
      call stacks .. \nC++ is already an open source (right?), so no black box here?"
