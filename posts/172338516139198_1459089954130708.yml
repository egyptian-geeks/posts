    message: I do, it helps with my deployment on AWS a bit. It is not super important
      tbh but it helps nonetheless.

      for those who recommend it, please tell us how do you update your docker containers?
      like if it runs app:1.1 and you release app:2.2, how do you handle updates, migrations, etc?

    message: "I think it depends on your project type, docker is perfect for production
      in use, but it's not perfect for all types of projects \nFactors that affect
      this decision are \n\n1. Will you need to move your project alot ?\n2. Do you
      need to scale your project by running multiple instances depending on load ?\n3.
      Does your project require specific configuration / dependencies or is it , how
      much time does it take to get those dependencies ready, and is their an easy
      way to run a script to install those dependencies?\n\nDocker is great but I
      think people over use products without knowing why this product is there and
      what problem does it self. \nDocker simply solves dependency and enable horizontal
      scalability of your product (  Portable swarm of instances ) ready to deploy
      faster."
