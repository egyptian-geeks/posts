      Story time :
      My cousin import shoes from China. We believe that some guy sent him a fake login Gmail login page and got his credentials ... Kept monitoring his email for so long and didn't change the password. He waited till my cousin's partner in China sent him a bank account number asking him to send the money then he deleted the email before my cousin see it ...
