  Is this the right way to use Math.Round method in C#? I've been searching the internet for help but wasn't able to come out with much

  Main() {

  Double num = 13.56;
  Math.Round(num);
  Console.WriteLine("num");
  }

  It prints out 13.56 instead of 14 for example. What am I doing wrong? How can I make it print the rounded value instead if the original
