    message: but  you casted the output back again to a float (output of max is a
      float). You should return an int instead

      I believe the application was optimized by substituting the function call with the function body itself.

      The following is a shot in the dark (فتي السنين): apparently when doing this substitution the casting of the parameters to int was ignored since passed values and return value has the same type.
