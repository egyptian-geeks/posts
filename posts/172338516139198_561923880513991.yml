    message: Everything has done perfectly, the quality is very good also the sound
      is not bad as you think of yourself (i was having the same problem while recording
      my first video i have wasted the whole day recording and then listen to myself
      and say Oooh No i'm terrible ,finally after some views i got some feedback that

      you continue recording more about this stuff.
