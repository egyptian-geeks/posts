  For Linux geeks:
  I saw people here (especially Islam Gad) talking about Elementary linux distro

  So I checked it out and it's amazing...

  I'm not really a linux expert but I'm trying to get used to Ubuntu and when I read about Elementary they said it's based on Ubuntu

  so can you please tell me what it's pros and cons ?

  Is it ready to be used on daily basis to do heavy work

  Is Freya stable enough or what exactly ? I just want to know what do you think about it overall

  Thanks a lot

  And in case some of you doesn't know about it here's a video:

      I can't confirm Freya stability as i didn't install it i only tried it once and it was beta before the release.
      But i really can confirm luna's version stability its already installed on my heavy daily working machine.

      Did you try KDE? How do you think it compares to Elementary?
      I'm running Kubuntu with KDE Plasma 5.3 but it's too heavy on my current system..I think Elementary is lighter.

      Hostilely i didn't try Kubuntu i only tried ubuntu, mint, deepin and i stayed with elementary.
      elementary is not heavy at all on my "Decent Machine",
      dell 3542 Intel Core i7 4510U 4gp ram and its not a wow resources as u can see even the i7 is not the best out there its a dual core and still can handle my daily heavy work on PHP development sometimes i end up working with 5+ heavy applications working together at the same time and with out any problems.
      Chrome, PHPstorm, MYSQL workbench, SmartGit, + some music ;)

      Yes it's amazing.. and also it's based on Ubuntu which is great as well
      My only concern is that sometimes heavy customization breaks stuff

      enables me to change the icons pack and change the dock theme (dock is called
