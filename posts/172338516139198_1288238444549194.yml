      Java is superior to the MS alternative in the following aspects:
      1. A multitude of frameworks,  (MS there is mainly one)
      2. Design patterns in Java implemented for better decoupling
      3. You can actually view the code that was written in the Java Libraries by Gosling and others (a great opportunity)
      4. Spring framework is a great way to learn MVC, DI and many other concepts at a deeper level than you would with .NET (I used both)
      5. The AOP in Java is very mature and powerful
      6. Java is the number one language worldwide for Job seekers.

    message: Java is also great because it is ope source and Free, meaning you can
      have totally free tools that are enterprise grade like Eclipse and the LAMP
      stack on Linux, you will also get better container support if you run Java on
      Docker on Linux. And all this for FREE not a single cent, you just download,
      install and enjoy. :)

    message: 'I''ve been working mostly with Java since 1999 till today (but also
      worked with PHP, RoR, Python, C/C++, .NET). If there is a single advice I would
      give anyone starting their software development career, it would be: Be a software
      engineer and never be biased to any language. Master the basics of computer
      science like data structures and algorithms and master one language really very
      well and then learn more languages as much as you can. PHP has tons of jobs
      and so is Java, Python and so are many others -  none of them is disappearing
      soon I guess. However good companies would be looking for good software engineers
      who know how to create high quality usable software. Having said that and back
      to the original question, trends that I see now are Big Data, Analytics, and
      IoT as far as I know but better to find good sources for good companies such
      as Gartener or LinkedIn who do research based on Business trends or job markets
      These are trends that are having growth now however old mainstream is there
      and will continue to exist. All the best!'

      -Start with an introduction to servlets and jsp

      -Modern frameworks in java built on top of servlets, in spring mvc u will find something called dispatcher servlet (front controller where all requests go for it and it delegates the request to the appropriate controller ), in jsf u will find something called facesServlet and so on
      - Spring framework is the most popular in java to build web apps so go for it after the introduction to servlet and jsp
      - ORM in java go for hibernate framework, there is alot but hibernate is the popular
      -web services in java, for soap use apache cxf, restful go for Jersey
