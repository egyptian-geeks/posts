  I really wonder why Arabic or even American sites follow the EU cookies law?!
  It's very annoying to find the ui cluttered with blocks of notifications for cookies, push notifications, ads, etc.

      I don't think it's just an arbitrary law.  I think it's more complicated than that. Websites store data on the client side, thus to make the ui more enjoyable.  Like password tokens, site preferences .... etc.
      Maybe, if a programmer or a hacker is..
      مصطبح
      can exploit these cookies.
      So, in this case user agreement is a must. So, to clear websites owners from any responsibility. And the poor user is the sole responsible ;)
