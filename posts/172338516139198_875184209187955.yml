  or is it just something you do because you have to, to make a living in web dev?

      Python do all the required type checking at runtime & gives you good error messages,

      People always mix between JavaScript the language and the DOM. A lot of the hate originally is caused by the horrible implementation of the DOM which really is browsers vendors' fault.
      JavaScript was written and shipped in 10 days. A lot of the bad parts in it is left for backward compatibility (like the only object in JavaScript that evaluates to false ... Something very similar to the reason why Microsoft named the new Windows 10 instead of 9 )
      When you spend long time with JavaScript you begin to understand how it works and you will begin to feel its beauty.

    message: Guys, I like Python cause the language itself has very nice and clean
      syntax, I like the indentations instead of curly braces, being a big fan of
      VB and also no more ";". The thing I hate about JS is it looks like C# and Java
      but it isn't. It also has very bad autocomplete and debugging and I hate being
      tied to a browser to test my code. Sometimes it is nice just to write some server
      side code or maybe some algorithms or even in Python a Tkinter application which
      is like a windows application. Also Python can be used for scripting and access
      the file system. JS on the other hands just does access to HTML elements and
      the syntax is never really that readable to me, whereas in Python I can read
      what the program is doing and understand. I can easily download Pycharm or Eric
      or even some Emacs mods and work on Python with great Autocomplete and debugging.
      I don't know how I can do that in JS, Also, even the JS frameworks you guys
      mention are mainly UI manipulation and I don't really get a buzz out of that,

      The Syntax.\n2- Poor autocompletion.\n3- Debugging.\n4- \"JS on the other hands
      just does access to HTML elements\".\n\nFor me these more like a personal preference/bad
      experience rather than the language itself.\n\n1- The syntax: You can use CoffeeScript
      which is white space sensitive, but I won't recommend this cause CoffeeScript
      hides some implementation details through it syntactic sugar syntax. I like
      it but I think ES6 is close enough for me to use than CoffeeScript. There is
      also LiveScript & TypeScript (but personally I think they look awful syntax
      wise). \n\nI work in a Python company (I'm not a Python dev), to be honest Python
      syntax is nice but the lack of closing bracket, or \"end\" like in Ruby makes
      me get lost sometimes and reminds me of callback hell/xmas tree http://res.cloudinary.com/joshwright/image/upload/q59qyti9rzkqvfjbb1dx.png
      in JS :D cause everything is going to right with no \"visual\" end)\n\n2- It
      depends on which editor/IDE you use, If you are an editor guy you will need
      to install some plugins for Sublime or Vim or <your text editor here> to get
      a decent autocompletion (might not be perfect, but it's good enough) or you
      might want to create your own snippets library for the pieces of code you use
      a lot. Or a combination of both. For IDEs (I hate IDEs, thats my personal preference)
      but I heard a lot of good things about https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ and
      its JavaScript capabilities.\n\n3- Debugging, mmmm... honestly I find debugging
      JS is not that hard, the amount of tool that we have right know is amazing.
      And also to prevent some issues you should use a linter (jshint or eslint) it's
      like PEP8 but for JavaScript so you can prevent syntax errors/bugs and only
      focus on real bugs, not a ASI bug or something. and console.log/dir() are your
      friends :D + the devtools (they are very powerful). on the node side there are
      other tools to use too to debug.\n\n4- This statement is wrong, the DOM is not
      JavaScript. The DOM is the browser API. Also, you have Node now which is backend,
      also used for apps using node-webkit Slack, HipChat, Atom editor etc... are
      build using node-webkit.\n\nMy personal advice, is if you don't enjoy JS don't
      write JS. Focus your energy on what you like Python, JS is gaining popularity
      yes but Python, Ruby, Java, whatever is not going to vanish (example PHP :D)
      maybe learn something else other than JS (Scala, Haskel, Go, something else).
      Also, please don't write JS cause you have too cause most probably you will
      write code that you don't care about but the poor Front-end guys like us will
      inherit this code and will lose our hair trying to fix it :D"

      It took me a long time to get how inheritence gets hacked in JS and I really didn't like it, it's not easy to wrap your head around prototypes compared to inheritence in other languages (like C# and Java).
      And I really don't like the lack of meaningful errors/exceptions and how sometimes "undefined" propagates everywhere.
      This all lead to a very bad experience when trying to make a simple 2D game with HTML5 Canvas.
      I know that I could use libraries to make things easier, but this just shows that the language itself on its own isn't well made.
