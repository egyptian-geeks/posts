message: Question to fellow geeks. Does anyone actually enjoy writing Javascript ?
  or is it just something you do because you have to, to make a living in web dev?

      of it. ASP classic was the same, I am trying to understand this.

    message: "JS has some really good parts mixed with really bad parts. underscorejs
      & jquery are examples of what you can do when you really know the language.
      \n\nBoth JS & Python are dynamic. Dynamic languages _can_ be strongly typed.
      Python do all the required type checking at runtime & gives you good error messages,
      e.g. \"TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\" at the
      exact line which contains the error. JS, although it knows about types, weakens
      the type system by doing automatic conversion, which is wrong most of the time.\n\nThese

      People always mix between JavaScript the language and the DOM. A lot of the hate originally is caused by the horrible implementation of the DOM which really is browsers vendors' fault.
      JavaScript was written and shipped in 10 days. A lot of the bad parts in it is left for backward compatibility (like the only object in JavaScript that evaluates to false ... Something very similar to the reason why Microsoft named the new Windows 10 instead of 9 )
      When you spend long time with JavaScript you begin to understand how it works and you will begin to feel its beauty.

    message: Guys, I like Python cause the language itself has very nice and clean
      syntax, I like the indentations instead of curly braces, being a big fan of
      VB and also no more ";". The thing I hate about JS is it looks like C# and Java
      but it isn't. It also has very bad autocomplete and debugging and I hate being
      tied to a browser to test my code. Sometimes it is nice just to write some server
      side code or maybe some algorithms or even in Python a Tkinter application which
      is like a windows application. Also Python can be used for scripting and access
      the file system. JS on the other hands just does access to HTML elements and
      the syntax is never really that readable to me, whereas in Python I can read
      what the program is doing and understand. I can easily download Pycharm or Eric
      or even some Emacs mods and work on Python with great Autocomplete and debugging.
      I don't know how I can do that in JS, Also, even the JS frameworks you guys
      mention are mainly UI manipulation and I don't really get a buzz out of that,

      It took me a long time to get how inheritence gets hacked in JS and I really didn't like it, it's not easy to wrap your head around prototypes compared to inheritence in other languages (like C# and Java).
      And I really don't like the lack of meaningful errors/exceptions and how sometimes "undefined" propagates everywhere.
      This all lead to a very bad experience when trying to make a simple 2D game with HTML5 Canvas.
      I know that I could use libraries to make things easier, but this just shows that the language itself on its own isn't well made.
