      Related: If for whatever reason you had to apply dynamic compression, and not from IIS (happened to me at one client), you can use this technique:

      This is the core technique, you can call it fro an MVC action or filter, or some webforms page or some HTTP Module or whatever.

      In my case we were injecting an Angular.JS app into a 10 years old webforms app (last updated .NET 3.5), and our web services were in fact webforms Page Methods if you remember those [ScriptMethod] ones. Only some of these needed the compression so we just called the helper where needed, but again, the technique can be used in several ways.
