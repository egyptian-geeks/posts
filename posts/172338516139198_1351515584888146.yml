    message: Yes, at the very least learn ObjC and the basics of creating an iOS app.
      Do it now before you dive deeper into Android and drown in details. Personally,
      I have postponed this step for more than 7 years and now I regret it.

      Well, you bring lots of topics to the table. Why is not it enough? And what defines a good developer? As I said, the Android ecosystem is so wide and deep nowadays, sharpening one's skills and keeping up to date is very time and mind consuming.

      With 1 year of experience, this is the perfect time to get a taste of everything. Not everything in the world, but at least everything in the field that entices you the most. With iOS development, not only do you need to familiarize with with the ecosystem but also the language, which gives a higher entry point that needs more effort to conquer.

      So, you want to be a mobile developer. Learn JAVA, and I do mean *learn* it, because people skimp on that. Learn ObjC, give Android, iOS and hybrid a chance and make sure you have seen everything, and decide from there. You have the chance now, it will be much harder later.
