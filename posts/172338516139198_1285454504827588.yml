message: "I know my question might seem silly , but does anyone here have a problem
  with torrent downloading with Orange (formerly known as mobinil/linkdsl) ISP ? I've
  tried restarting the router , deleting the torrent both download link and client
  , used VPN , made blood sacrifice to the router \U0001F602 but no use."

    message: I am using linkdsl, and I make torrents downloads without a problem.

      all.
