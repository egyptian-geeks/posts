  Hola Geeks,
  I need your advice, more like guidance or experience.
  I'm currently on the track for a Bachelor's degree in software engineering but I suck at software design and architecture.
  Every time I'm designing a software I don't really know what to do to best design it, I know some design patterns and practices but It's never enough, what would you advice? What would be a good exercise or a project to learn from? Any valuable resources you know of?
  Thanks.

    message: 'A difficult question to answer as this skills is built more with experience
      and hands on. I would suggest you do two things, 1. reading design patterns
      with practical examples and projects. 2. participate in open source projects
      where you can learn a lot. I also find reading Java core libraries source code
      and how they are designed very useful. For (1) above, if you haven''t read GoF
      Design Patterns book yet, I highly recommend it for you as a start. It goes
      through the patterns and have an example application, a word processing application
      that illustrates the usage of design patterns, so you get to know how to use
      each of them. I read this book 15 years ago and I am still so grateful to the
      GoF :)   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns This one gives the basic
      design patters, in Java EE, there is another set of patterns targeting web applications,
      J2EE Design Patterns, I read this one and it was extremely useful: http://corej2eepatterns.com/
      Next higher level is at architecture level, I didn''t come across a single good
      reference, but you can start from here as an index to explore more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern
      however I wouldn''t care about the architecture level as I start, that''s more
      advanced and related to large distributed and integrated systems. First master
      the GoF design patterns, then the Java EE core patterns if interested in web-applications
      development (especially on Java platform). All the best :)'
