  Very important Notice,

  Please guys give more attention to our group policy and your target audience. We are not html5 beginners and we don't want to know how to clean our RAM. Think twice before you share something and before you add your post in your group and ask your self. is this something that will really make people open their mouth when they see it? if the answer is yes then go a head and show us your power.

  We look for Quality and not Quantity. we don't want to end up as any random group for sharing links as this is not our target.

  We are here to share our knowledge with you, give you the best answers to your questions and to keep our community a luxury community for the top Geeks in Egypt.

  Thanks to all of you who keep up with our policies.
  Mohamed

      The group's purpose is to share the knowledge and experience of top notch egyptian
      engineers.\n\nIf someone's looking for a job, then this isn't the place to expect
      one. Other groups do that well and 9 out of 10 job posts here are replicated
      elsewhere. \n\nSome even go as far as reposting the same offer here again a
      few days later. These I gladly remove."

      Course ads are another problem, I'm all for sharing learning material of a certain quality intended for a certain skills level. But the "hey learn embedded systems @ this super dope seminar/training center course" is simply BS.

      We should strive to raise the bar and ask people to step up to the plate and enhance themselves as techies, not follow the ideology of a convey travels at the speed of its slowest vehicle.

      Will it alienate some? Yes. What they do about it is up to them. Ask, learn and get better or be lazy. Fortune favors hard work.

      Oh yeah, I'm totally against job posting and courses in the group it affects the quality of the group however we made a vote and the guys suggested to leave the job posts and I respect the people who voted for that but we have to make some rules if we want people to respect them. like don't come and add a post about how to clean your ram! or a position for a junior graphic designers i feel very angry when i see these such posts. I kind of take it personally like an insult to the minds of our members.

      +1 for Amr Eldib and Hady Ahmed My total respect for both of you buddies :)

    message: This is the first time I see Facebook Group Mods exert that much effort
      and give that much thought about moderating the group (I usually see that happen
      on Reddit not Facebook), just wanted to say that I really appreciate what you
      guys are doing here :)
