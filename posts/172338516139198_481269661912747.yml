  - description: "[Source: http://j.mp/RCzA46]\r\n \r\n A few months ago during my
      first end of year review at Microsoft I was doing an assessment of my year. 
      One of my personal goals to come out of this reflection was to improve my personal
      productivity.  While I hear many people say “I wish I had more hours in the
      day so that I could get more done” I feel like that is the wrong approach. 
      There is an inherent assumption that you are being productive with your time
      that you already have and thus more time would allow you to be as productive
      given more time.\r\n   Instead of wishing I could add more hours to the day
      I’ve begun adopting a number of processes or behavior changes in my personal
      life to make better use of my time with the goal of improving productivity. 
      The areas of focus are as follows:\rFocus\rProcesses\rTools\rPersonal health\rEmail\r\nNote:
      A number of these topics have spawned from reading Scott Hanselman’s blog posts
      on productivity, reading of David Allen’s book Getting Things Done, and discussions
      with friends and coworkers who had great insights into this topic.\r\n \r\nFocus\r\nPre-reading
      / viewing:\r\nOvercome your work addiction\r\nMillennials paralyzed by choice\r\nIts
      Not What You Read Its What You Ignore (Scott Hanselman video)\r\n   I highly
      recommend Scott Hanselman’s video above and this post before continuing with
      this article.  It is well worth the 40+ mins price of admission for the video
      and couple minutes for article.  One key takeaway for me was listing out my
      activities in an average week and realizing which ones held little or no value
      to me.  We all have a finite amount of time to work each day.  Do you know how
      much time and effort you spend on various aspects of your life (family, friends,
      religion, work, personal happiness, etc.)?  Do your actions and commitments
      reflect your priorities?\r\n   The biggest time consumers with little value
      for me were time spent on social media services (Twitter and Facebook), playing
      an MMO video game, and watching TV.  I still check up on Facebook, Twitter,
      Microsoft internal chat forums, and other services to keep contact with others
      but I’ve reduced that time significantly.  As for TV I’vecut the cord and no
      longer subscribe to cable TV.  Instead I use Netflix, RedBox, and over the air
      channels but again with reduced time consumption.  With the time I’ve freed
      up I’m back to working out 2-3 times a week and reading 4 nights a week (both
      of which I had been neglecting previously).  I’ll mention a few tools for helping
      measure your time in the Tools section.\r\n \r\nProcesses\r\n   Do not multi-task. 
      I’ll say it again.  Do not multi-task.  There is no such thing as multi tasking. 
      The human brain is optimized to work on one thing at a time.  When you are “multi-tasking”
      you are really doing 2 or more things at less than 100%, usually by a wide margin. 
      I take pride in my work and when I’m doing something less than 100% the results
      typically degrade rapidly.\r\n   Now there are some ways of bending the rules
      of physics for this one.  There is the notion of getting a double amount of
      work done in the same timeframe.  Some examples would be listening to podcasts
      / watching a movie while working out, using a treadmill as your work desk, or
      reading while in the bathroom.\r\n   Personally I’ve found good results in combining
      one task that does not require focus (making dinner, playing certain video games,
      working out) and one task that does (watching a movie, listening to podcasts). 
      I believe this is related to me being a visual and kinesthetic (using my hands
      or actually doing it) learner.  I’m terrible with auditory learning.  My fiance
      and I joke that sometimes we talk and talk to each other but never really hear
      each other.\r\n \r\nGoals / Tasks\r\n   Goals can give us direction in life
      and a sense of accomplishment when we complete them.  Goals can also overwhelm
      us and give us a sense of failure when we don’t complete them.  I propose that
      you shift your perspective and not dwell on all of the things that you haven’t
      gotten done, but focus instead on regularly setting measureable goals that are
      within reason of accomplishing.\r\n   At the end of each time frame have a retrospective
      to review your progress.  Do not feel guilty about what you did not accomplish. 
      Feel proud of what you did accomplish and readjust your goals for the next time
      frame to more attainable goals.  Here is a sample schedule I’ve seen proposed
      by some.  I have not consistently set goals for each timeframe, but I do typically
      set 3 small goals a day (this blog post is #2 for today).\rEach day set 3 small
      goals\rEach week set 3 medium goals\rEach month set 1 large goal\rEach year
      set 2 very large goals\r\n \r\nTools\r\n   Tools are an extension of our human
      body.  They help us extend beyond what we can physically and mentally do.  Below
      are some tools I use almost daily or have found useful as of late.\r\nDisclaimer:
      I am not getting endorsed to promote any of these products.  I just happen to
      like them and find them useful.\r\nInstapaper – Save internet links for reading
      later.  There are many tools like this but I’ve found this to be a great one. 
      There is even a “read it later” JavaScript button you can add to your browser
      so when you navigate to a site it will then add this to your list.\r\nStacks
      for Instapaper – A Windows Phone 7 app for reading my Instapaper articles on
      the go.  It does require a subscription to Instapaper (nominal $3 every three
      months) but is easily worth the cost.  Alternatively you can set up your Kindle
      to sync with Instapaper easily but I haven’t done so.\r\nSlapDash Podcast –
      Apps for Windows Phone and  Windows 8 (possibly other platforms) to sync podcast
      viewing / listening across multiple devices.  Now that I have my Surface RT
      device (which I love) this is making my consumption easier to manage.\r\nFeed
      Reader – Simple Windows 8 app for quickly catching up on my RSS feeds.  I used
      to have hundreds of unread items all the time.  Now I’m down to 20-50 regularly
      and it is much easier and faster to consume on my Surface RT.  There is also
      a free version (which I use) and I can’t see much different between the free
      and paid versions currently.\r\nRescue Time – Have you ever wondered how much
      time you’ve spent on websites vs. email vs. “doing work”?  This service tracks
      your computer actions and then lets you report on them.  This can help you quantitatively
      identify areas where your actions are not in line with your priorities.\r\nPowerShell –
      Windows automation tool.  It is now built into every client and server OS. 
      This tool has saved me days (and I mean the full 24 hrs worth) of time and effort
      in the past year alone.  If you haven’t started learning PowerShell and you
      administrating any Windows OS or server product you need to start today.\r\nVarious
      blogging tools – I wrote a post a couple years ago called How I Blog about my
      blogging process and tools used.  Almost all of it still applies today.\r\n \r\nPersonal
      Health\r\n   Some of these may be common sense or debatable, but I’ve found
      them to help prioritize my daily activities.\rGet plenty of sleep on a regular
      basis.  Sacrificing sleep too many nights a week negatively impacts your cognition,
      attitude, and overall health.\rExercise at least three days.  Exercise could
      be lifting weights, taking the stairs up multiple flights of stairs, walking
      for 20 mins, or a number of other \"non-traditional” activities.  I find that
      regular exercise helps with sleep and improves my overall attitude.\rEat a well
      balanced diet.  Too much sugar, caffeine, junk food, etc. are not good for your
      body.  This is not a matter of losing weight but taking care of your body and
      helping you perform at your peak potential.\r\n \r\nEmail\r\n   Email can be
      one of the biggest time consumers (i.e. waster) if you aren’t careful.\rTime
      box your email usage.  Set a meeting invite for yourself if necessary to limit
      how much time you spend checking email.\rUse rules to prioritize your email. 
      Email from external customers, my manager, or include me directly on the To
      line go into my inbox.  Everything else goes a level down and I have 30+ rules
      to further sort it, mostly distribution lists.\rUse keyboard shortcuts (when
      available).  I use Outlook for my primary email and am constantly hitting Alt
      + S to send, Ctrl + 1 for my inbox, Ctrl + 2 for my calendar, Space / Tab /
      Shift + Tab to mark items as read, and a number of other useful commands.  Learn
      them and you’ll see your speed getting through emails increase.\rKeep emails
      short.  No one Few people like reading through long emails.  The first line
      should state exactly why you are sending the email followed by a 3-4 lines to
      support it.  Anything longer might be better suited as a phone call or in person
      discussion.\r\n \r\nConclusion\r\n   In this post I walked through various tips
      and tricks I’ve found for improving personal productivity.  It is a mix of re-focusing
      on the things that matter, using tools to assist in your efforts, and cutting
      out actions that are not aligned with your priorities.  I originally had a whole
      section on keyboard shortcuts, but with my recent purchase of the Surface RT
      I’m finding that touch gestures have replaced numerous keyboard commands that
      I used to need.  I see a big future in touch enabled devices.  Hopefully some
      of these tips help you out.  If you have any tools, tips, or ideas you would
      like to share feel free to add in the comments section.\r\n \r\n      -Frog
