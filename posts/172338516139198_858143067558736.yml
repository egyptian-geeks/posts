      .NET is not a threat to PHP. E market is big enough to handle both.

      With backing from Facebook, WordPress and others, PHP is here to stay.

      Like Meligy said, there's room for everyone. But I'm here to comment on the call to learn Ruby on Rails. I've been doing ruby for so long that I've seen this comment creep up almost everywhere, along side to nodejs, python and lisp. Now lisp, is easy to justify.

      But please, could we just stop with the "learn something" because fuck it's cool or popular? Could we be a bit more objective, justify your suggestion.

      Don't just throw a "learn x" without giving a person some reasons why they should take your word for it.

      it's not the shiny new toy anymore (that's node now) but many people make living
      from it, like others who earn from .NET, and PHP. Cool to learn another tool
      and add it to your bag of tricks, but you don't "have to" most likely

      Like I said, be objective and state your reasons if you know any and are not just reiterating a hyperbole suggestion because it sounds cool and looks cooler. That's how we establish rich arguments and enrich one another with our backgrounds and experiences.

      Blanket statements tell me one of two things, either the person knows too little about what they're talking about or they're just throwing in their 2 cents for the sake of participating but adding nothing.

      بص الموضوع آن آنت في سوق و مهارتك هى السلعة لو مهاراتك مشايهة لمهارات الي معاك في السوق حيبقى الطلب عليك قليل، خةها من المنطق ةا حتلاقي ال PHP and .NET مهارات ماليه السوق، آنت حاول تشوف السوق فيه إيه مميز و آتعلمه و حتلاقي الطلب عليك كتير و كمان المهارة سعرها أغلى.
      أنا عن نفسي رحت ل Python and Django لو لاحظت آن السوق كبير و الطلب كتير و الموارد قليلة

      Alaa, there is s new framework called .NET core. It's like RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and is very light that every application can have it's own version of the framework.

      Everything is now in packages. ASP.NET 5 (in the works) is a complete rewrite of ASP.NET and a decoupling of the entire. NET into NuGet (think NPM) packages.

      Badawi, WordPresd is not dying any time soon. Definitely not just because there are other lighter alternatives out there.

      There is a whole ecosystem around WordPress, businesses worth lots of millions of dollars built just around WordPress.

      For marketers and other business people who just need a flexible CMS the WordPress ecosystem with all plugins and commercial offerings available is yet to have any proper competition, those are the ones that pay money, and their money keeps the ecosystem alive

      Just stop thinking that the success of one platform necessarily means the death
      of another. That's just silly. I mean really, just stop.
