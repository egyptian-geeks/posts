  stress, performance) \n1- If i have REST API \n\n* Is there any tool that \n****
  Generate unit test cases automatic for the code?\n**** Do stress testing for the
  API?\n**** Do performance testing for the API?\n\n* Is there any concern related
  to API that read from Hadoop HDFS?\n\n* Finally Is there in general tools that generate
  Test Cases in general for Scala Code \"Scala run on JVM as Java\".\n\nJAK,"

    message: There are some tools that generate test cases for your APIs. generally
      it is preferred to develop your test suite (because you are the one who knows
      what is the proper usage scenarios and data/logic flow, ...). Based on these
      scenarios, you can easily generate load/stress/performance tests. I have been
      doing just API development for the last year and half for mortgage industry
      in US, we process 4 out of 5 home loans in US). Developers use SoapUI, QA use
      TestNG, performance engineers use load runner)
