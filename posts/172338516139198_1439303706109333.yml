message: "Hello folks, I hope you're having a great day. \nI've been motivated to
  buy an e-book reader, I can't find any brands other than (Kindle from Amazon). \n\nI
  ask for your help to find a good price for the well known Kindle Paperwhite E-Book
  Reader. I was thinking to order it from souq.com but I am afraid that it will not
  work as expected and may be have some technical faults that I will not notice instantly.
  \n\n- Do you know a good store that sell it?\n- Is there some tips for testing the
  device before actually buying it?\n- If you've any information that will help, please
  tell me\n\nThanks in advance :)"

    message: I think kindle is the best ebook reader out there..  I would recommend
      waiting a little before buying it from souq..  Maybe the Amazon acquisition
      thing would lead to better offers on amazon products on souq

    message: If you plan to get it from Amazon, then definitely wait for deals. I
      got mine on cyber Monday or black Friday weeks, and it had 40€ off.

      I have a Kindle paper white and it's great for reading .mobi files, some stuff to keep in mind:
      - it's screen works perfect in the light, no glare at all
      - it's slow, don't expect it to work as a normal tablet
      - best format for it is MOBI, pdf works but it zooms out the page and zooming in won't help you, MOBI text reflow so you'll have to get your books in that format.
      - it resist hits and falls quiet well, I had it fall 3 times form my pocket and works as expected, just hanged and had to hard restart it
      - it fits in you pocket which is perfect (either jacket or back pocket of your jeans)
      - it's eink screen is really soft on my eyes, doesn't strain at all, also I turn off the light completely while reading at day, and on lighting setting no7 at night.
      I highly recommend it for reading
