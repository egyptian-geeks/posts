      Good stuff, but reminds me of horrible college days :)

    message: In college, I used a tool called pyggy (parser generator for Python).
      We were able to finish the project faster than all the teams who used lex +
      yacc. I was able to convince 2 other teams to use it & their result was good
      as well. In the next year the TA responsible for the project told the students
      that Python was not acceptable (your batch I believe Ahmed T. Al-Amir)

      This is a bad start, the writer needs to define the language specifications and gives the big picture first. Usually, compiler implementation requires defining the language (in BNF format) and then work from there ... the main steps are lexical analysis (using lex or flex, the purpose of this article) and parser (something like yacc) ..
      I don't consider this article as C implementation, it's more like using flex (and probably yacc or the like in future). Some of C implementation aspects will be memory management, efficient garbage collection, etc...
