      Make sure that you have added Google's Maven Repo to your project as the earlier version of Firebase requires that.
      You can this repo as following ...
      Open your build.gradle File (Project level)
      allprojects {
          // ...
          repositories {
              // ...
              maven {
                  url "https://maven.google.com" // Google's Maven repository
              }
          }
      }
      Hope that Helps :D <3
