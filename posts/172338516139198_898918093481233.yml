      It all boils down to what you're trying to do, and your resource consumption patterns. For example, Ruby has a rich library, but its loops are slow. They make it up by using C (or Java for JRuby) to implement most important functions. Python can be a memory hog if the developer is novice or just not careful enough. C++ can be fast, but you'd probably use a bridge to expose it over an API. Java can be even faster in some cases due to dynamic optimization, but it usually allocates a lot of memory to minimize the overhead of the GC. Go compiles to native code AFAIK, but it's knowledge is very rare, and so are its libraries. JavaScript and PHP have optimized VMs (e.g V8 and HHVM), but due to their dynamic nature I doubt they can do much to an algorithm that could make use of CPU vector operations. Vector based languages such as R and MATLAB are best for number crunching.

      So what is it that you're trying to do? :-)

      If you are still going to release the app, there is no need to worry about scaling. You won't hit the ground with scalability problems!

      Scale when you run into scalability problems. Not now. Otherwise you will spend a lot of time and money trying to make the app scalable, and end up releasing it too late or not releasing it in the first place.

      I believe that productivity is more important that runtime, if you write everything in C I can guarantee it will run fast but it will probably take ages to implement and maintenance will be need a lot of time, you need to balance between productivity and performance depending on your needs, usually for prototyping you prefer productivity and then for implementation you find something that provides a good balance.
      but to answer your question, C++ > Java > C#/.NET > Python > Ruby, not sure about PHP but I think it's between C++ and Java.

      بص على حسب  :-
      1- ال algorithm :-
      بيعمل ايه , يعني لو الموضوع مجرد تعامل مع ال database يبقى ممكن نقول node مع mongodb هيبقى فل , لو فيه شغل complex ك algorithm يبقى انت محتاج حاجه اخف لان ال node بتستهلك memory كتير , لو علشان ال concurrent connections يبقى ممكن node مع socket.io او خدمة زي parse او firebase , لو هتحتاج شغل على ال geo  يبقى خليك مع database  MongoDB او Postgre
      2-  المبرمج :-
      مبرمج php  جامد و عارف هوه بيعمل ايه احسن من مبرمج node او python مش عارف بيعمل ايه .

      بإختصار , ابعد عن ال .net و ال java , ركز مع Node او go او python انسب لموضوع ال webservice و ال api
