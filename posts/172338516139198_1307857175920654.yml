    message: In big companies sometimes they call it experiments like for example
      assume that you have a booking button in your app you will create two colors
      for this button for example blue and yellow and for each user you will apply
      a small algorithm to specify the user type whether he is a or b and according
      to the user type you will change the button color. this type of testing will
      help you to determine which button color will attract users to your app and
      make more bookings or stay more in the screen , it is just analytic way to test
      the user interaction with a new feature
