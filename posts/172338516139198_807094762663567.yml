    message: Who cares? I never used it and I never met anyone who still use it. Yahoo's
      wrong decisions has been killing everything good they did in the past.

      A lot of websites are built on top of it... plus that PureCSS is built based on YUI
      And in all cases it's sad to see a project with nice history comes to an end

    message: It's not surprising, considering this project is almost 8 years old.
      In web years, this makes it ancient. Most of the problems that YUI solved no
      longer exist or were fixed more elegantly by competing libraries over that time
      period.

    message: IMHO, I'm actually glad it went down the drain. YUI and Scriptaculous
      were two black dots in the web's gray history book. Scriptaculous died out 4
      years ago, now it's YUI. Can't wait to see ExtJS go down as well but that's
      not likely to happen.

    message: YUI has a long and storied history and the first version of ExtJS was
      a ripped-off copy of an earlier version of YUI. Literally just took it, renamed
      YUI to ExtJS and off they went. It's a matter of time till ExtJS follow the
      same path.

      2005, and was first announced to the public on February 13, 2006. Although it
      has evolved tremendously since that time, YUI has always served the same overarching
      purpose of providing a comprehensive toolkit to make it easier forâ€¦
