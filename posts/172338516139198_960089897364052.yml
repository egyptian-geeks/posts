      The definition varies and there are classifications to that

      May be this encyclopaedia page can be of a little help

    message: Hacking really requires intensive amounts of time writing code and reviewing
      existing code.. you can't consider your self a hacker without being a code guru
      in the first place so you can be able to write exploits, backdoors and other
      tools with very good understanding for networking protocols.. using only other
      people tools is not really called hacking not to mention experienced hackers
      don't trust other hackers tools unless they have its source code..

      To me hacking is being able to adjust a system to a need unintended by its creator. When I write atrocious CPP to generate code for me, I call that hacking. If I attach a Lua repl to a game so I can automate something, hacking too. If I can gain access to something via a sql injection into a searchbar, also hacking.
      I visited a hackerspace some months ago, where they hacked a 30 year old weaving machine and removed the mechanical-copy-template part and instead made it controllable from a PC. Then they bought another weaving machine and combined them to print a 3D patterned scarf.

      Bottom line: If you (ab)use something to fit your need, you are hacking it. The child hacked their system, because it did so without use of any specialized tools. The people you call hackers aren't creatively modifying anything, they are using prewritten utilities made for that specific purpose. They are doing penetration (testing), not hacking.

      I share the same understanding of "hacking" as Ahmad Fatoum, when I abuse the Extension Methods feature in C# so that most of my code looks like one-liners (something.DoThat().ThenThat().Then(c => c.ThisThing()).ThrowIfBad()) ... I feel like I've wrote hacky code, which looks very awesome but is very unreadable to somone else :D
      I find myself doing that because I don't like useless intermediate variables (ones that I use only once) and I don't like having code where the order of method names is the opposite of their execution order, for example int.Parse(str.Substring(0, 2)) instead of str.Substring(0, 2).ParseInt() where ParseInt is an extension method I wrote

      With all due respect, Maybe you don't ... but,
      Let me borrow the "Script kids" expression ... u know how many of them living on this planet +1ed? just google any "how to hack .. something" and see the views !

      When they grow older, wiser and want to code  ... I am sure they would love to GIVE A SHIT and see such advice.

      I really liked that video, I think I might be directing people towards that video in a bunch of situations even if it has nothing to do with programming, it's a nice response to hateful people who just want to hate on things instead of actually dealing with them.
      (this post and comments weren't hateful though from what I've read, just fun talk)

      What I wanted to say is: it doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter. Those are all interconnected areas and you can be following a process ava having to hack certain things, etc.

      Hacking is often used to mean "putting this thing together without really knowing what I'm doing". I need to know what I'm doing most of the time, and I  have needs to use things I don't know about as well so I hack stuff together.

      So, which side am I in? In polite words: I don't care, and I don't think you should too
