message: Hi all, this probably is a noob question as I have absolutely no experience
  in front end work. I'm using 2 libraries in a website, both have a CSS class with
  the same name which causes a conflict. Is there a way to resolve this conflict other
  than renaming the class?

    message: Why is this even a problem whilist you can just override the class with
      whatever you want? In CSS, whichever appears last wins! Moreover, Javascript
      would come in handy whenever you need to manipulate some attribute on the fly
      -but not to be used like this unless necessary-..
