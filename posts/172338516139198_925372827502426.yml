    message: Yup ... use it all the time. It's quite good for tech savvy users but
      hard to grasp if you want your clients and customer to use it to report bugs.
      We use it for bug tracking internally and to host git repos

    message: In my experience, it was hard for our customers to use. We use it internally
      only. Like I said if you want something that involve input from your client
      I think you should look for better options.  It's really hard for me to compare
      it to JIRA cause I never used it.

      Alaa Attya Mohamed, if the only reason is that your colleagues don't like it, give them some time.

      We use JIRA at work, we made the switch from Pivotal Tracker. I hated everything about the move. But eventually I got used to it. And now I don't have any problems with it.

      Set it up properly, and give them some time.
