  Anyone here working on their own ideas?

  Are you struggling with marketing them, reaching to potential audience, or converting these into paying customers?

  If you are keen to talk about these here, maybe I (and others) can help.
  I can offer you ideas, strategies, and more focused tips and tools.

  Also, feel free to message me privately if you don't feel like posting details in here. And don't worry, I won't charge you for it!

      Oh, that's a perfect time for this post.

      So, I've worked on around 5 projects, kollohom fashalo el 7amdolellah. There was one that actually had potential, but Cambridge sent us an e-mail and they were not really happy about it and therefore we had to take it down. The other 4 were either clones of already successful ones, or technical nightmares. A few hours ago I've also submitted a PSD to Themeforest and "it didn't reach their quality threshold."

      I know that's not directly about marketing or so, but maybe it's close enough. It would be nice to know what do you think.

      geeky ones. I'm not expecting to find those trying to get a weight loss or physical
      craft workshop in here. Feel free to stop notifications of this post though
      if it feels wrong, or to discuss with the group founder and other admins if
      it should not be here at all

    message: 'Well, one thing to remember Amjad Mash''al is: you sure heard about
      how existing competition is not a bad thing (your thing about clones), and how
      it''s also market validation. I don''t know if you find help in me saying it
      but: I have found that this is SO TRUE. If you are the first to do something,
      it''s too risky and maybe no one wants you idea and you might want to go through
      more validation steps to tell otherwise.'

      I have zero experience with marketing.. What I only know is to create the idea and a good attractive website for it  and maybe pay for some Google ads.. And thats it for me :/
      Know where exactly I should start ?

      Hi Muhammad Saleh,
      The http://entreprogrammers.com/ prodcast can be a very good start, also check the 80-20 marketting book

      Marketing is a big part of every business, I see it this way, geeks have the know-how, they also can feel potential markets, but why do geeks work for others? Because they don't know how to run a business with all its legal stuff, marketing, etc ...

      If only geeks can get how to run a business, they won't have to work for a bunch of (e3mli 3 kilo features) people.
