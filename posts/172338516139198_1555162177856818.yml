message: "To all iot giants out there. \nI saw https://cylonjs.com/ and\nhttp://johnny-five.io
  and they look interesting! \n\nSo it sounds like i can finally use my js to command
  embedded devices. \n\nquestion is\n\nLeta say i create an http server and used cyclon
  and firmata protocol to upload that to arduino/raspberry pi. \nThis server will
  listen to http request and based on it it will turn led light on/off. \n\nI have
  done this using pubnub already and it works as expected. But the board must be connected
  to my computer in order to work. \n\nWhat do i need to make this device work independently?\n___\nEdit
  please check link in my first comment"

      AFAIK, it's not possible to host a Javascript runtime on Arduino due to resources limitations. When you use Johnny-Five or a similar framework, it actually runs the code on your PC/laptop.

      But it's definitely possible for Raspberry Pi since it runs Linux.
