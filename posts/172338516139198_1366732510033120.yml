  I'm implementing REST service..
  can I have both "content-encoding" & "content-length" headers?

  when I added the "content-encoding": "gzip" header the "content-length" header substituted with "Transfer-Encoding": "chunked"

  by the way I'am using spring.

      Yes, you can have content-encoding and content-length, but you can't have Transfer-Encoding: chunked as well as content-length (nor do you need to).

      No experience with spring.
