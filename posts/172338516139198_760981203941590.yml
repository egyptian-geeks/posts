      Apple is not serious? do you know what Mac OS X based on?

      I am not Apple fan boy by the way, I am just interested in the internal of OS and I read some.

      The only justification for them using Windows is "The availability of certain software", they can't even use Windows 7 or 8 because of the driver architecture which will require changing lot of things.

      they use it when its convenient (Design) but manufacturing if they make their own software that would be an idiot move from Apple!

      Let's ask the question in a different way. if you are the owner would you invest on making the manufacturing software to run on Mac ?

      I Just think that Apple has upper hand as Hardware company, build its hole ecosystem around i-gadgets but MS is powerful in software, software that are deeply integrated into different areas from basic computer tasks to giant scientific research centers. someone will told me that MS achieve that with its past monopoly strategy. thats funny because MS software is the BACKBONE for every hardware vendor on the plant as Dell, HP, Samsung ... while Apple things is exclusively Apple ONLY.  this Apple strategy is whats called monopoly, and has extreme effects on computer market prices.
      I have no doubt that every single one on this group learn or partially learned coding and computer skills on PC, not MAC :)

      I did zero coding/code learning on PC, only linux and occasionally a mac...
      And what apple does is not monopoly, it is what's got it to deliver great products like iTunes while MS was so busy trying to copy apple by doing the zoom music player...just for example
      In fact, Microsoft windows market share in overall devices have dropped that they are no longer the major controller (refer to linux bug report #1)

      Hahaha, Great products .. just a copy from American lifestyle dilemma, In fact Steve Jobs is a great marketing guy and make the right decision to change Mac entirely to A Linux with catchy animations and cool backgrounds, but you don't forget that price tag rich boy.
       MS copied some Apple successful projects whats the big deal, Apple copied the whole touch concept from Abandoned MS project called Courier for god sake .. be reasonable, think about third world countries for example, and see the costs of computing if the world move with apple strategy and MS not exist. I think open software movement and Linux enthusiasts that defend MAC today will cry tomorrow.

      the one and only one type of thinking is very wrong. computer market is healthy

      guys who bashes every single product from MS, just for bashing only. Yes, admit
      that Apple dominates in American market now. but most of Americans interests
      are so different from World interests. they just want fancy things. \nAbout
      Yosemite, Apple has a way shorter product lifecycle than any hard or software
      company (and thats not good btw, fancy but not good), it releases almost every
      year a different iphone, ipad and different OS. Whats the difference between
      them all ... very tiny and fancy little details (in my opinion)."

      Well, they do incremental upgrades, take a look at the iPad Air now and the original iPad, also, remember that this is a product line established 4 years ago.
      As for the short life cycle, the iPhone 4 got iOS 7 but not iOS 8, that's 3 years for a phone, that's 2 years shorter than a laptop for instance and far longer than most of the other products.
      I truly am not fond of how MS runs their business, releasing a tablet model after the other with no idea or target to what they want to do with the device, instead, once they release it as the "iPad killer" and next it's the "MacBook Air killer".
      Also, comparing the price, setting up a Microsoft powered computer to do essentials is pretty expensive compared to getting everything apple makes for the mac/iOS for free, even educational pricing makes Apple far more gentle on the pocket

      graphics card on your windows/Linux desktop gets old or inadequate for your
      uses? You take it out and get a new one. If your rams become too small for your
      software, you just go get a new stick. With apple products, if your hardware
      is more than 4 years old, it becomes unsupported and no software updates will
      be available for it.

    message: This is not a windows vs osx issue. This is a pc vs Mac issue. PC is
      generally more open, there are thousands of hardware and software combinations
      and manufacturers. But with apple, you are limited to what apple allows you
      to do. Which is why all the serious work is done on PC's, while the most serious
      work anyone can do on a Mac is edit a video.

    message: "MS has disastrous decisions, and very disappointing products. but what
      i'm trying to tell is that Apple strategy is also very bad. so we need a descent
      review for both products. not silly apple vs ms like most American fancy techblogs
      on the internet. \n(for ms powered computer vs mac powered, i think both will
      cost the same, may be mac even higher. for example productivity software on
      both aren't free, apple makes its office replica free last year, but i think
      ms reduced office costs insanely .. don't forget that office is a major money
      pump for ms now, besides that all software will cost you on both platforms)."

      Most serious work you can do on a mac is edit a video? Well, how about "a bug's life" for video editing? Which crushed ants and prince of Egypt (produced by dreamworks)
      Plus, all coding lessons that I am taking are done with screencasts featuring the mac :/

      Well, Apple is not god, walled gardens are still walled so I'm just hinting at what could be a better option from my point of view, Microsoft still charge iOS users a fee for using office for instance, plus, for my work flow for instance, I find that using a Linux or a mac a lot better than windows which doesn't even come with a powerful terminal like Linux or mac (not to mention the interface that makes my eyes bleed whenever I look at it)

      I hate unity on Ubuntu for instance, but I still prefer it over windows interface
