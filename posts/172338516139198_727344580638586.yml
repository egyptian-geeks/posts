      explanation and what exactly are we talking about in terms of organizations
      empowering startups.\n\nAccelerators, VCs, Incubators, Summits/Conferences,
      Co-working locations? Educational bodies like Injaz or startup competitions
      like Startup battle Egypt which we sponsored last year along with the 5-6 other
      Startup weekends that took place underneath it? \nName one whose operations
      are on hold. Hence, my request for an explanation ;)\n\ncc: Moutaz Hodhod"

      Hady Ahmed  this local initiatives are totally cool but there is no big boys stuff here.
      What do you do to get 1 million USD for tech startup in Egypt as a fund?
      It is shitty and I don't think it will get any better soon, You can have better chances raising fund in Dubai more than here.
      Here most investors are coming from the background of brokerage and real estate, looking at the last 10 years, how many industrial entrepreneur had his business running in Egypt and how many are willing to put money in this new thing called tech
      on the other hand most Gulf countries use international consultancy offices which technically not as good as the real investors but with the guidance they have they can make some use for their money

      I think this is what meant when he said Startup activities are sort of on hold in Egypt.

      don't consider events and summit as big thing, it is educational thingy, it is all part of infrastructure.

      The real deal is people who put money and it is clear that it is not easy to get anyone put money now.

      and you know my stance about the shit hole we're in, wont reiterate over it
      again, a topic for another day.\n\nMy objection was the stark statement which
      is _literal_ in nature. No one put their operations on halt, except maybe Tahrirsq
      slowed their pace significantly. \nIs everything at ground halt? No. Is it good
      enough? No but that's irrelevant to the subject matter being discussed now."

      I see no problem in Intel closing its offices either, it's a business decision. Call it as you may, bubble or anticipated economic collapse. This trend of optimizing business operations has been going on since 2012.
      It's hitting everyone.
