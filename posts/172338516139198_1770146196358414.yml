    message: I like the discussion but the problem I see is that even if you don't
      believe in the cause or the problem, this post is not asking you for help or
      support, it's basically calling for females who want to participate in a group
      to help each others, in other words people believed in a problem, and tried
      to help each others, whether you agree with the problem or not, you can't deny
      the respectable attitude.

    message: 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions! Programming = not a
      gendered issue! Have you guys learnt nothing from western feminist bullshit,
      The James Demore case?? Huh? Bottom line is: its in WOMEN''S favor to compete
      against males in a male dominated industry without affirmative action - AND
      VICE VERSA - Its beneficial to let males compete against women in a female dominated
      industry. Why? Its how capitalism and competition work, you only become better
      at something when you are forced to compete with more competent people. Encouraging
      women in tech is fine, the line you should never cross is expecting or demanding
      equal representation (i.e equal outcomes)'
