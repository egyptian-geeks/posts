message: 'Question for the mobile developers here: I have zero experience with iOS
  and Android so excuse my ignorance. I''m working with a vendor that''s consuming
  a RESTful API I''m maintaining and every time they face a problem with the APIs
  and I ask them for a request sample they give me a hard time and they almost never
  send an actual request (header, body) nor a response. Their argument is that they
  can not access the raw request data because neither iOS nor Android SDKs allows
  them to do so. Like I said I''ve never touched neither iOS nor Android but I''ve
  been writing software for almost two decades under multiple environments and I find
  that hard to believe, Can this actually be true or are they just incompetent?'

    message: You should have some sort of middle layer like postman or swagger where
      both of you should use, to make sure languages/libraries/tools don't affect
      the requests.

    message: I've never needed to do it in android, and it probably need some extra
      work to get the raw request/response, but you can easily get each component
      of it like header, body, params...etc on it's own using get methods from the
      response object

    message: Incompetent is the right word, if I understand you correctly. Unless
      you are using a binary format, it should be quite easy to capture these details
      either in logs, or using a proxy (like Charles). As long as we're talking about
      dev builds here, not live releases.

    message: I would say they just don't have enough experience using other people's
      APIs and communicating to the backend devs about it... One of the easiest ways
      to get the full request/response with headers and everything from a mobile app
      is using Charles proxy, it has a free trial and it's a self-intuitive gui tool,
      so ideal for that case

      Tool. Maybe ask them to do that
