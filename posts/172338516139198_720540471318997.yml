      Are you using ruby on rails or sinatra?

      What authentication strategy did you use with omniauth?

      Are you having a problem in redirecting the user? Or in submitting the login form?
      Edit: Also do you have a user model and an identity model?

      Redirecting is easy, you just use

      'redirect_to some_routes_path'

      This some_routes_path will link to some controller action that has a view. Depending on your database layout, if you have a User model, inside the action just acquire the user record that just logged in using

      '@user = User.find(session[:user_id])'

      Then in the view, you have access to all the information you need through the @user variable.

      Note: Usually, you'd have a helper method called current_user (by conventions) laying around in your ApplicationController, that finds the currently logged in user using the session variable you previous set. If you don't have it, you need to implement it. (Since you use omniauth, you'll need to implement it)

      I can't help much without knowing what code are we working against. Do you have a User model? What information does it carry? what information does your Identity model carry?

      Good luck.

      You can use this for a reference implementation: https://github.com/railscasts/304-omniauth-identity/tree/master/auth-after

      And watch this if you have trouble understanding something:
