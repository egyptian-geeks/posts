      But I do something *It might not be the optimum solution*
      I have an app called caffeine which prevent your mac from sleeping
      And reduce the screen brightness to the minimum and then the apps and network would be running normally

    message: You could install an application for that named No Sleep, but i stopped
      using it long ago, one time it didn't work probably, i left my laptop in the
      bag and found out 2 hours later that the laptop was actually awake. You can
      imagine the how hot the laptop was at a  time!!.
