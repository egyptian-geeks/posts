  An amazing documentary about the journey to build the navigation computer that Apollo 18 crew used to navigate their ship when they were on the dark side of the moon.

  Computers at this time used to be huge and heavy and it was almost impossible to use the same computers used in the 60s for that journey. The documentary shows how MIT staff wrote their programs and how they built compact small machines that wasn't possible at this time.

  There is a lot of interviews with software developers who worked on the mission and a lot of interesting information for us as programmers. During the landing process they had an error with the code 1202. It was the code for the overflow error. Normally it should've crashed but thanks to an engineer who built a revolutionary operating system at this time that allowed the computer to dump less important tasks and operations in favor for the important stuff.

  This is a documentary that is worth every minute of your time to watch. Enjoy it.

      Whenever I learn something about what they did with such low resources, this bit always comes to my mind:
