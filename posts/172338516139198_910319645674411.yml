      after a quick look on the API page, i guess the problem with the Request Header Content-Type value, the default is usually text/plain, and you are sending a base64 image data in the body so you need to make the Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      and make the body similar to : "image={StringContent Here}"
      + i guess you may need to use Uri.EscapeDataString(image);

      after looking at this example : https://github.com/eirikb/gifie/blob/gh-pages/app.js
      now i can see the problem is the API is expecting JSON data in the request body, so you need to make the Content-Type: application/json
      and the body : {
      image: "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7",
      type: "base64"
      }
      * This works for me and uploaded a tiny 1x1 px gif image using cURL ;)
