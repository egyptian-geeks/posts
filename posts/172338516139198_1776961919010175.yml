message: "Hi, i am trying to build a new application, for multiple platforms, (web/ios/Android)\nI
  found this SDK which could help me a lot,\nIt called FaceSdk by luxand, \nhttps://www.luxand.com/facesdk\nthe
  SDK provides Delphi, c++, c#, java \n( i don't like cross platform)\n but, in this
  case, it will be more suitable? Or I am wrong? \nHint:(it's not free + i am just
  building some  experience , not going to build a commercial application ,)\nis there
  is any free(open source ) SDK/framework provide those features ?\nfeel free to give
  me your full opinion, i am not a professional Software engineer, but i am trying
  to make my hands dirty,"
