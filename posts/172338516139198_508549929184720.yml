    message: the question is a bit tricky, and the answer itself is kind of a clever
      hack. You can tell by the number of up-votes for example. It is interesting
      this guy doesn't have any other question or answer on SO, ever. Put aside the
      fact he seems to live in another planet with this localised VS, and already
      has huge issues in learning things with his obviously v. poor English.

  - description: Is it possible to develop NodeJS applications with VS2010. I'm talking
      plain ol' Javascript, not Azure or any fancy stuff like that. I just want to
      use VS2010 as the Javascript editor as I'm from .NET background and I'm very
      comfortable with it.
