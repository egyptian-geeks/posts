      Nice article. Unfortunately I found that some people don't know a lot about passwords.

      I suggest that you add a little explanation of what are the differences between bcrypt & sha1 hashing, so people know what they should use

    message: In encryption you can get back the decrypted password by knowing the
      key, so the idea is where to store the key ?. however, while performing hashing
      on a string, you can not get back to the original string.

    message: I would like to note also something about using hashing. You can get
      collisions so easily ( a repeated hash), so you need to use open addressing,
      or any methods that appears in algorithms books. Also using hashing is so fast,
      o(1) or o(n) worst case, so its better to use it to look for people's passwords
      in database instead of using their names..etc.

      1. Hashing passwords should be slow. If it's fast, it will be easier to break. Fast hashes (like MD5) are for file validation
      2. If you use hashed password only for user lookup without using salt, you can log in if you write the password for _any_ user

    message: Mohammad Tayseer Sorry, I didn't clear it..I mean about fast is about
      the searching or look up not about the way they are stored.

      user login feature, and you must store the username and password in your system.
      Most of developers stored these precious information in database as plain text,
