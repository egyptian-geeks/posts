message: Guys I would love to hear your opinion/experience on a problem I have been
  researching which is how Uber/Careem update the driver location like real time.
  The only obvious way I can think of that the drivers devices send their location
  each small interval of time like 2~5 seconds, but I know that there is a limit on
  the number of free requests by google. What is the best way to handle this? Is the
  only way to pay google for the extra requests :)? Would love to hear your experience
  on that.

      Drivers have their own application which is always running in the foreground. The Location libraries in Android allows you to listen and be notified of location changes through a function called onLocationUpdate or something similar. My guess is when the driver location changes the app sends it to Uber servers.
      I don't think it is related to Google or Google Maps API. It should be purely based on Android or iOS.

      Google has nothing to do with this, the device (meaning the phone) itself is capable of determining the current coordinations, that's what the GPS does, that's totally free if you want to implement something like it, sure you can.
      on the other hand they are paying Google for using the visual map and the driving direction services, but they still and you can use any alternative service (ex: openstreetmap) or even implement you own.
