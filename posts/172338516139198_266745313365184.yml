      no one says Steve Jobs is not a great guy, it is just that, at the end of the day, everyone must be tagged with what he really did!
      you can also watch "Pirates of Silicon Valley"

      Some people didn't like the fact that not educated man or specifically not engineer build with his OWN vision a whole company that changed computing history ...
      first of all, I admit it .. he is not an engineering guy, but his not a totally idiot (he worked on early days of his career for Atari, building some game consoles) ...
      my words doesn't mean that all credit of the Mac want to him, for sure Woz is the engineer that build the system, but who think that computers MAY be sold out of the enterprise ecosystem, who bring the idea that all people can use computers if they had GUI ..
      After expelled from apple (his own baby), he didnt give up, but work harder to prove himself to the bunch of investment idiots who fire him,so he he sold the ABANDONED animation division of famous lucas films, and make Pixar ... the first and most influential animation studio on film industry later ...

    message: At that time Apple ruined without him, and Microsoft be the no.1 of the
      tech industry, does Woz or any other on Apple saved her (even they have the
      technology, on thier hands) ... No
