    message: This is very interesting, because lately I've changed from loading data
      page by page from the backend using a request/response cycle, to just dumping
      all the data once onto the clientside in a JSON string and having the clientside
      process it and deal with pagination in the frontend, because it does make a
      huge difference in terms of user experience in responsiveness (after initial
      load, everything is immediately responsive instead of waiting for the request
      response cycle every click).

    message: Only thing I'd add is be careful when the JSON string size gets more
      than 1mb in size, then you will have to deal with data transfer times as well.
      I had a 5mb string size (tens of thousands of records), and the way I solved
      this issue is by compressing the string using gzip compression, converted it
      to base64,  (string size was reduced by 80%) transferred it to the frontend,
      then converted it back and decompressed.
