      COBOL is very much in demand, thanks to legacy systems everywhere.

      Systems like this are probably too expensive to replace, hiring someone like this to maintain them is easier than going through the trouble of porting the old system or building an alternative from scratch.

      I think some Egyptian banks are still running COBOL systems to this very day.

    message: Yeah no surprise, 14 years ago they taught us COBOL/AS400 in school as
      a mandatory course, told us there is still demand for it because of legacy systems
      used by banks.  These systems are incredibly stable and IBM made it to be 100%
      upward compatible, and is still updated and supported by IBM until today, which
      is why so many companies choose to continue using it rather than switch to something
      which can break down and go obsolete in a few years time, but what a horrible
      language COBOL is.
