  Is it just me or has the number of people complaining about "X software is eating my RAM" increased significantly, with the usual suspects being Chrome and Firefox?

  I mean, why do you have RAM if you do not want it used? Lately, I have been noticing people reacting with the good ol' Egyptian spirit:
  ده انا احرقها الرام دي و لا انك تستخدمها يا سوفتوير يابن اللذين.

      Some people do not have too much RAM. Several expensive laptops come with 8GB of RAM. Some people also have naturally-RAM-Hungary apps like IDEs or DBs or legacy corporate apps.

      When combining a few RAM hungry apps together,  you might run out if RAM and your OS caches stuff to disk.  This degrades your're system performance even if you have an SSD.

      that will be used for extensive work and settling for 8GB RAM.

    message: RAM is just one factor in laptops purchase.  I used to have a 32GB RAM
      ThinkPad and i once had a VM with 12GB of RAM because I had to use some customer
      server simulation apps that were RAM Hungary. I sometimes ran multiple VMs at
      the same time. Now I have a Macbook with 16GB of RAM. If Chrome takes more than
      4GBs RAM, this means the max my Parallels VM can use is around 8-10GB RAM without
      OS system degradation.

    message: It was not actually the main point of the post, but you should choose
      the machine that suits your needs not the other way around. If you need 32GB
      to finish a task, then your problem is the machine that does not have more than
      16, not that you should limit your tasks to suit your machine.

    message: If you use a frugal OS like Linux you will have a lot better RAM statistics.
      I feel much better when my Debian starts with just 125 MB RAM. As for browsers,
      I noticed, Chrome and FFox use a lot, but I guess that is the price of having
      so much JS and media running. Other than that, I have a host OS (Ubuntu) for
      browsing and checnking out multimedia. Then I have a custim built dev environement(s)
      one is Gnusense, which takes 175 MB RAM, Debian based, the other is Debian with
      only a file manager and no fancy Desktop UI. I have notcied that with Linux,
      you can have UI that is much fancier than windows (my subjective opnion) AND
      you actually make a lot better use of HD space and Network bandwidth. I can
      send you many more statistics if you like. So 16 GB RAM with Debian is great
      because the host only takes 100 -400 MB depending on Desktop UI, which you can
      even choose at boot time, so you can oick a different one each time. Also with
      an SSD, you will notice a tremendous speed increase so you won't even have a
      problem with the heaviest apps.
