  Hey guys,i just want to mention that my experience with the new android emulator is really awesome and unexpected..
  I was working on Android studio and I had many problems with the emulator as I have a low specs laptop..I had to close all my Linux apps on using android studio to be able to work smoothly..but on running the emulator in most cases my laptop freezes so I stopped using emulator..
  After watching the last android developer summit I wasn't excited by the new features but after switching to the canary channel and trying the new emulator I was able to run it in a few seconds with Google chrome (the RAM eater) and the emulator worked very smooth with the new awesome controls, Instant ru, Drag & drop and many features..although it's in preview version but I recommend you to try it :'D
