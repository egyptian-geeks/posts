message: "at least full networking is coming to bash on windows , hope this mean that
  tools like nmap and such could finally be used with this build \n\nbut unfortunately
  this update is only available now if you participate in the insider program and
  downloaded the build [which is buggy] so i was wondering if there is a way to just
  update the WSL , like replacing the binaries for it for example ..,, anyone have
  ideas ?\n\n"

      Any idea why this issue is not resolved yet by this change?
      https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/468
