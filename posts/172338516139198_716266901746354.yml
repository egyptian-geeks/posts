      You see, that's my biggest problem with everyone working with a so called "agile process". Agile is like sex, everyone seems to talk about it but hardly anyone does it right.
      There is nothing wrong with agile, except if you use it in the wrong context (Read enterprise).
      The article is so bad it drills holes in my head thinking about it, but that's the case with philosophies. There's so much depth in one that you seldom find people who truly understand it.
