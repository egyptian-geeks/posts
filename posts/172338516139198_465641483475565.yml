    message: So you say.. next thing would be the danish and the french (western countries),
      are backing those comics, and USA is backing Google (a major software company)..
      One thing leads to the other and software would be "7aram Shar3an" :D

    message: you spoke in a totally different direction, what i mean concentrated
      about movie hosted by google not all the software companies and not all the
      western people as you mentioned. i mean we cant be so silly but other-way not
      so negative on that issue.
