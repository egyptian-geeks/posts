      How good is raising fund, or how bad is it?

      I've always believed that the best way is to keep funding yourself. It always sounded bad for me that someone would take 10% of what you made.

      Some business models/types can't really realize their true potential without massive sales and marketing investments, which is the case at Vezeeta. While some other ideas we read everyday on TechCrunch and VentureBeat make it seem easy for a group of 2 or 3 engineers to get traction you need to factor in the difference between the Egyptian market and the US, the difference in target customers, if your startup are going after developers for example a reddit or hacker news post or a TC coverage can get you known but if your target customer is healthcare protectionist (read: doesn't care or necessarily understand technology) you need a field sales force which costs money, allot of it.

      And for the 100% argument how valuable is it to own 10% of nothing compared to less percent of something.

      The market potential the area we are working on is undeserved if served at all in Egypt. and we have a strong vision (some already implemented) to connect different parts of the healthcare ecosystem this has lots of potential.
      I would also add the founding team expertise at the same level.

      Amjad Hesham Mash'al The idea in Funding is that the investor actually has the rights of a percentage you agree with him of shares at your company. which gives him benefits in one of 2 cases:

      1. company enters the stock market.
      2. Company is being sold.

      Other than that he doesn't have the more right in anything else. so if you think that not accepting 50K USD in an early stage and you have no idea if your product will be accepted in the market or not and if your business model is working good or not then you are in a big troubles dude and this is because you are too inlove with your product which can cause a lot of issues if you find out your product is not making money and you need to shut it down you will prefer funding it your self increasing loss and you will end up loosing your product and money.

      Mohamed Alaa El Din, I'm not planning to sell my company I'm planning to extend and get bigger. We've been working for 2 years and we make enough money to fund out stuff. We had projects that failed and projects that partially succeeded, or actually really succeeded if compared to the market size. That's why raising funds didn't make sense for me. Why would I raise funds if I'm already going good? And I'd rather work 2 more hours a day to raise more money to be able to hire people than give 10% of the company to someone else.

      It definitely makes sense if you're planning to make a project that depends heavily on money, such as a hardware thing or so, but in my case I don't need that, and I wanted to ask what makes their company need funding.

      Only the founders and people involved can asses if raising fund can be good for the company i just wanted to state:

      1. Some ideas can't be materialized without funding either yours or external
      2, If you are profitable that doesn't mean you don't need to raise fund (i.e GetHub)
      3. Funding and bringing partners on board is **really** not just about money

      focus on how your business model can make money from Day one you shouldn't even
      open :) making money from day is a validation that you are good for moving forward

    message: Mohamed Alaa El Din, Nope disagree back at you :) some ideas (i.e Facebook,
      Pintrest, GitHub, SnapChat, Tesla and others) had to take funding to make money,
      regarding validation getting paid for your idea is one way to do it, but user
      engagement is just another one.. its just some ideas needs some expensive work
      to get to a stage were you can charge for them or get revenue from ads...etc.
      Idea validation is a whole another beast you can't just put it simply as getting
      paid for the idea while it's certainly a way as i mentioned.
