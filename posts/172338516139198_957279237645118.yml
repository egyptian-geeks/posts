  MicroPython is a special version of Python 3 which can run on a microcontroller (Pyboard). The European Space Agency is funding it.

  On this attached link, you can see it in action & even write code to run on it :)

      Yes, I was looking for high-level languages that run on embedded systems, how embedded is this system though, how much memory does the board have ? I couldn't find this piece of info.
      Running the code on the board from the browser is very nice, I have to say :)

    message: I believe OpenWRT runs regular python which can run on any system with
      a couple hundred megabytes of ram (Rpi, mobile phones, routers, etc), however
      the system we have here has a couple hundred kilobytes of ram

      OpenWRT is a whole linux OS (so you can do lots of things), while PyBoard runs only a special version of Python. I think OpenWRT vs MicroPython is like RaspberryPI vs Arduino.

      I'm not an expert. I just searched for this for 5m, so take this with a bag of salt :)
