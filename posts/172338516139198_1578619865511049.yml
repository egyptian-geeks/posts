      End Devices. \n\nWith games such as Final Fantasy and Parasite Eve, both created
      by Square Co., Ltd., you can enjoy the beauty of pre-rendered background images
      while at the same time, use 3-D models in the game. Mixing 2-D and 3-D graphics
      has been a highly guarded secret of game companies, and it’s a secret that’s
      worth exposing.\nFor developing Unity/Unreal engine games for mobile phones,
      it's challenging to work for low end devices with low GPU capabilities. \nThe
      idea is to a draw a pre-rendered 3D Image (2D) of the scene that you want to
      create. Use a highly detailed pre-rendered backdrop and a simplified version
      of the mesh that you used to render the scene in the 3-D modeler. Use the mesh
      to render out the Z-values and for collision detection. Three-dimensional objects
      can then rely on the Z-buffer to handle drawing the right depth."
