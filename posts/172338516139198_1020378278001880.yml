message: I started Harvard's CS50 this year around June, and sadly, I'm completing
  it in a bad rate really, now I'm near the end, just doing Pset 7, then it will be
  pset 8 and the final project. So I don't really what shoud I do after finishing
  CS50 ? I'm looking to be a software engineer, probably I'm going to learn python,
  although I'm not entirely sure, I like c and I'm interested to learn c++. The main
  problem that the next year, I'll be in my final year in "ثانوية عامة", so it would
  be really hard to keep going the next year, specially from January of next year.
  So I was asking for the best thing to do in this time, so I wont waste this time.
  Thanks alot in advance.

      Take your time with CS50 it's quite comprehensive and worth studying every detail.
      I'd advise on taking an Algorithms course right after, you can take Stanford's Algorithms course, it's easy and has some nice material, also not long or time consuming.
      (You can apply the algorithms in Python to improve your knowledge of it, if you need a good introduction and since you know C you should try CodeCademy's)
