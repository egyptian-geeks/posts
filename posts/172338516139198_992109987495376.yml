  preview it in a decent way so i can see different cells with different colors ?

    message: Would you specify more? Are you asking for a function in a specific Programming
      language, or you just need a tool for visualizing your data?

    message: "Then, I'd recommend going with any statistical computing programming
      language as they meant to solve such problems. \n\nR programming language, in
      my opinion, will be very helpful in your case. \n\nYou can start by this simple
      Codeschool tutorial:\n-- http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1\n--
      https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r\n\nThen, take a look at these articles:\n--
      http://www.phaget4.org/R/image_matrix.html\n-- http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/r/matrix_contour/\n\nOctave
      is another opensource good option: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"

    message: "You could try Octave:\nLet matrix A be the matrix you want to plot,\nimagesc(A)
      \ \n%would give different color representation for each number.\nimagesc(A),
      colorbar, colormap gray;\n% same thing but with different shades of gray.\n\nThis
      would probably work on Matlab too (as most commands work on Octave work on Matlab),
      however I only tried it on Octave."
