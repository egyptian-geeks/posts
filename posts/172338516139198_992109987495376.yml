    message: Would you specify more? Are you asking for a function in a specific Programming
      language, or you just need a tool for visualizing your data?

    message: "Then, I'd recommend going with any statistical computing programming
      language as they meant to solve such problems. \n\nR programming language, in
      my opinion, will be very helpful in your case. \n\nYou can start by this simple
      Codeschool tutorial:\n-- http://tryr.codeschool.com/levels/1/challenges/1\n--
      https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r\n\nThen, take a look at these articles:\n--

      is another opensource good option: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"
