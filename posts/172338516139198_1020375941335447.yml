    message: "nice article, \n- it seems that Go shares some ideas with scala (GC,
      one-liners, native concurrency model, )\n- it looks that \"defer\" is same as
      context mgr in python: \"with ... ():\"\n- it is not clear how to manage the
      goroutines as well, how many threads are spawned? are they context-switched?
      or each routine has its own thread?\n- python and scala (and java) come with
      a lot of standard libraries that make our life easier, and \"trusted\" non-standard
      libraries with large adoption that make our life even more easier :D I wonder
      if this is the case in go\n- how does network stack work in go? is it comparable
      to erlang/python/scala?\n- I don't like GC since it might add unpredictability
      at run time (at least for critical tasks) can we turn it off in go?"

    message: Go is a fantastic language but depends on your needs. also still the
      debugging in GoLang is not that mature yet and you need to be expert in low
      level programming specially for debugging GO.

  - description: A few months ago, I couldn't answer the "What's your main programming
      language?" question. I found out about Google's golang and started learning
      it. In this blog post I'll write about some of my thoughts on Go after I've
      been using it for a few months now.
