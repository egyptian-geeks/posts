      Just wanted to ask about the reasons that would make you choose using it. Some real and personal reasons, I already did a lot of searches, but not convinced yet with what I got of results, So I'm seeking for personal thoughts.

      And the second question is how did you managed to start thinking of it as a server side language ? How did you start to think of it differently ?

    message: "I've used Node.js in a realtime project. That depended heavily on sockets
      and instant responses. During the lifetime of the project only 3 or 4 requests
      cycles are made and around 10 sockets events are fired. \n\nI used Node.js as
      a rest server with AngularJS. Node is quite responsive when it comes to heavy
      number of requests. \n\nIt's also all about asynchronous calls, So you'll face
      a lot of hard times trying to figure out why a function returns undefined when
      it should've returned a value. Then you'll figure out its event-driven approach,
      And you'll really have to get your head around it in order to be able to create
      anything using Node.js. I literally mean it, If you can't work with events and
      manage your code according to it, just stay away from Node.js, But If you did,
      you'll find programming using Node.js just magical :)"

      NodeJS. \n\nThis is an example using django & NodeJS, but it can be applied

    message: "Mohamed Meligy Sorry for late response. About your question Randa Hisham.\n\nTo
      be honest, I was hosting the app on a personal computer and was a part of a
      network.\n\nBut generally, Node.js creates it's own process (web server) and
      listens on a particular port. You won't need Apache at all. In fact if you want
      to host a Node.js application on apache you'll have to do some work. \n\nSo
      you can host a Node.js app nearly on any server but it varies in the difficulty
      to get it running. \n\n1 -  You can just run Node.js by itself on a server without
      apache and tell it to listen on a certain port.. But you'll have to manage error
      handling and stuff like that. Becaus if an exception is thrown and not handled
      the process of the application stops and will not be responding until you restart
      that process. \n\nYou'll have to make sure also that no other application on
      your server is using the same port node is using. especially if you're using
      web sockets.\n\n2 - You can use Node.js in combination with nginx to create
      proxies i think in order to prevent any port blocking (not really sure if this
      is the only benefit )\n\n3 - You can host it on Apache, But you'll have to do
      some Virtual Hosts stuff. Not really sure.\n\n4 - You can use PaaS or IaaS,
      Which handles nearly every server maintenance task. Like rebooting in case of
      an exception, load balancing, deployment and starting/stopping your app.\n\nPaaS
      is like Heroku and Nodejitsu \nIaaS is like Amazone AWS\n\nNote: I did some
      researches before and readings to get this information. Please if there's something
      incorrect about it tell me. Thanks."

      Thanks Mohamed Meligy I will take it from here :D (My Favorite Part Thank You)

      Node.js is built upon libuv, a cross-platform library that abstracts apis/syscalls for asynchronous (non-blocking) input/output provided by the supported OSes (Unix, OS X and Windows at least).

      Pola Ashraf it depends mostly on what you need. NodeJS & Socket as Most of the members mentioned are the best solutions for sending messages, notifications and making non-blocking code (Async) which in normal cases if you try to do it alone with any programing language you will need a queue server to process them in the background.

      Another Things is how fast NodeJS/ExpressJS respond. they take 10-30ms which is awesome.

      Randa Hisham I use NodeJS in Production apps and I made a test on  my server to see the concurrency and I got 2500 concurrent request which is 150K PRM (Request Per Minute) So I believe You are doing something wrong that blocks the server and there for the server goes down.
