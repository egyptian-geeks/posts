    message: It's kinda a late step BTW. People were wondering how much freedom Satya
      will be able to get around doing things his way and differ from Balmer if Balmer
      is still on the board (which advises and evaluates the CEO). Many people were
      surprised that Balmer didn't step down from the board shortly after.
