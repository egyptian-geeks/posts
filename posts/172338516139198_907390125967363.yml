  Lately, there are a few posts asking about pieces of hardware. I found them "not exactly following the group rules" but as and admin I didn't really decide to delete them, specially that they were commented on by a few group members.
  But, today is the second time I find one of these flagged by group remembers, i.e. it's not only me that find those posts on the fringes of being spam.
  So, what should we do?
