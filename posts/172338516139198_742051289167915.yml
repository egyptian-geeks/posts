      Failure to monetize will always result in a closure. I'm happy it's getting some media coverage, should be a reality check for anyone thinking that it's a matter of slamming a website online and then claiming they're a business.
      Quite frankly, the only bubble I see in this industry is the hyperbole shit of "entrepreneurship for all". No different than "Everyone should learn how to code". Just more bullshit.

    message: Also not to forget, they've had some moderate levels of success. For
      half a million active users a month, that's not bad. Below what's dubbed as
      average but still solid enough for a series A if they weren't bootstrapping.
      However, if one can't capitalize, one should go home.
