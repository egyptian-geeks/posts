      I was honestly always an AMD fan, their processors used to be just as good (and in many instances better) for half the price. The athlon 64 was in many ways superior to Intel's chips at the time. My issue with them later was due to their lackluster support of Linux. Their drivers were faulty and quite buggy, to the point where the online community started to develop open source drivers to improve support in Linux. This is when AMD lost me. After a while it just wasn't worth the hassle to have to deal with compatibility issues on Linux all the time, so I switched to Intel.

      The problem is now Intel is at the point where they have a monopoly on the computer market, and something like this happens and you realize one of the reasons why monopolies are bad.

      I hope AMD makes a comeback after this. If they can't turn this into their favor, then they really are beyond helping at this point.
