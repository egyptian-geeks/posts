      Quoting the comment I talked about:

      This is a very old post. A few things happened since then, including that the writer left Angular team and now is working on bringing his own almost dead competitor DurandalJS back to life.

    message: I am no JS expert as I have said on this group, but from my experience
      with geeks and Technology, it looks like this guy should have been a leader
      in that team. I also do not trust companies as much as I trust geeks. I would
      be interested though to know if there are other alternatives that are more community
      driven and not part of some commercial company. It sounds like Ubuntu and Canonical
      here and that is why many people moved to Linux Mint and other distros.

    message: So we had AngularJS 1.X, then other people created AngularDart (Both
      share the name only, nothing else!) & now we have 2 frameworks! AngularJS liked
      AngularDart, so instead of merging both projects, AngularJS 1.X team decided
      to recreate AngularDart from scratch!!!

    message: That is what i am talking about i had an investment in Anguler 1.x and
      now its discontinued in favor of the new version, As much as i like the framework
      i couldn't use it again and risk having to port the whole codebase to the new
      version sometimes in the future and it's not like 5 or 10 years its few months.

    message: It's not exactly like that, although pretty close. The Angular team is
      pretty much the same people working on AngularDart. It allowed them to experiment
      with several things they liked.
