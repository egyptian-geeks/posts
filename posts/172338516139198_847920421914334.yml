    message: Frankly it was kinda expected. The nice things about Durandal like the
      shell and stuff are very different from Angular. It felt too to be true that
      Angular would care about these. But he didn't have a lot of choice. His Durandal
      kickstarter failed and it was obvious he was losing against Angular

    message: The funny thing though, his post about Angular 2 then this conflict are
      going to bring him a lot of empathy and get Durandal so much traction that was
      nor possible without these events!

      ... Correction, it came out 4 days ago before he announced he was leaving. I
      may be misunderstood, I didn't mean Eisenberg was on the podcast ... It was
      Craig McKeachie and he was talking about how he revamped the routers and a lot
      about his  contributions.

    message: I heard the name "Rob Eisenberg" for the first time a week ago ... and
      it popped up in my feeds and podcasts A LOT since then. I think he have something
      worthy.
