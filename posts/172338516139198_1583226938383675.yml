      Where is that screen? And where did you get your app from? Even their official help mentions the normal way of doing auto update https://m.facebook.com/help/456186367793974?helpref=faq_content

      Maybe your app is a system app, so it's privileged to do so, or you downloaded it from elsewhere other than Google Play?
