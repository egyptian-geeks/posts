      Eslam Hamouda Ruby's MRI threads implementation is green, so context switching takes place through the GIL, so yes there will likely be a read-write lock issue with the file but it wont throw any errors.
      The problem is in the image variable, that's a plain check-and-set race condition, there is really no reason why it should be living in the global namespace.

      Emad Elsaid I'm sorry buddy but I dislike the code. It's a tips & tricks post so it should offer idiomatic ruby code with proper styling and good solution design. I took the liberty and made this https://gist.github.com/l0gicpath/9163091

      The notes I had about the code:

      - The simplest http server should still send header information

      - tabs should be 2 spaces (soft tabs) per indentation level

      - variables if started with a letter, the letter should be in a lower case

      - The server should hand off connections as fast as possible so move the dependency on an external process whose purpose is a shared interest into its own context

      - Spacing spacing spacing :D between operators +  - >=

      - Ruby probably has one of the largest collection of string literals, do. not. use. string concatenation for long strings

      - Stay consistent with double and single quotes, lines 19 to 23

      Result? Still a very small code base (50 SLOC) but in the true spirit of ruby :)

      There is a lot more to ruby than meets the eye, python also ships with a basic httpd, the httpd Mohammad Tayseer mentioned is just a standard unix utilities script that ships with ruby std (lib/un.rb). WEBrick is the standard embedded http server that ships with ruby, if you're half serious about doing something that won't scale then that's your thing. If you're serious then you're better off with a middleware like rack.

      We also have a resuable generic server implementation for any application layer server "gserver", the "xmlrpc/http_server" is just an example implementation not intended for reuse.
      The command is not uncommon, ruby interpreter can do a lot of things from looping your script turning it into a REPL all the way to executing ruby commands.

      All in all, there are probably a dozen different ways to build any server of any kind in ruby. Emad Elsaid you'll do yourself a lot of good reading ruby's code then moving over to ruby's implementation code (the c interpreter)

    message: Shotgun is not a web server, it's an automated code/environment reloading
      extension to rack. Specifically it replaces rackup, offers automatic code reloading
      in cases when you change the code and want the changes detected without restarting
      the server.
