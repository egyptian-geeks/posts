  Sending & receiving emails is a pain in the neck. Mandrill is trying to solve this problem. It's very fast. The free quota is 12K/month, which is enough when you're starting. It's by MailChimp, so they know what they are doing.

  Notable competing services are SendGrid & Postmark.

    message: SendGrid allows you up to 200 emails/day for free, but it's not shown
      clearly on their pricing page :). See the orange button at the bottom. http://sendgrid.com/transactional-email/pricing

    message: 40K for $9.95 on SendGrid & $5.60 on Mandrill, so Mandrill is cheaper,
      but I believe both are cheap

      Ses is the cheapest of them all, bundle it with sendy and you get a cheaper version of mailchimp in the long run.

      It's worth noting though that mandrill and ses have a ramp up period. In mandrill you're never given the 12k on day one. You have "up" to 12k for free monthly but you need to reach it. They start at a ridiculously low quota until you're rates are good and you're verified as a trusted sender.

      Your email opens vs unread ratio is high, your spam reports ratio is low, email opens vs click through ratio is also calculated.
