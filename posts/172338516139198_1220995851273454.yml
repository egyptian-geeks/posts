      My opinion, use ionic only with prototype projects or startups, don't use it with large scale or complicated projects.
      There's many disadvantage for using ionic instead of native like anyone can review ur ionic code , http/s apis or take  ur ionic app and change the logo/ name and put it on google market again by his name with few easy steps. But ionic nice for speed up your release and test ur market for startups
