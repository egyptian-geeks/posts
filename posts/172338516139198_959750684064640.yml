      Do you have multiple disks or partitions? Are you sure it's loading from the C: or from this disk at all?
      Double check the disk first, then use the "fdisk" tool (by bringing the command prompt after you open the Windows CD installer, I think it's F3 or F10 that brings it, google it, and google FDisk). With FDisk you can make sure the partition you want is the primary one and can actually delete and create it. If you can clean the entire disk (the command "clean" inside fdisk") do it as well.

    message: Osama Soliman Linux has become so much more user friendly and has so
      much documentation and help, including such a helpful community that you will
      not only survive, you will flourish. Also, you can code .Net on Linux as well
      as any other language, you can use MS Office documents and it uses very little
      system resources and is extremely stable. I advise you to try ubuntu as the

      Excuse me commenters. This thread is not about moving to Linux. I'd recommend if you want to talk about that you can open a new thread on the topic.

      This is a question about certain software. Suggesting to completely replace the software with a radically different one is an overkill IMHO.

      Not to mention that there is a possibility that this is a booting issue unrelated to disk configuration not the OS itself.

      I did find Linux so much easier to install and so much more stable and even
      the beta versions were more stable even than some final Windows versions. Also,
      the term free is purely objective as it is really free

      But am I the only one who faced this problem ? I hv checked the latest tweets ... everyone is saying #Windows10 is an amazing miracle :S
