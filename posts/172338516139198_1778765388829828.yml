      in real world projects that actually running online not just a bunch of code
      placed as a dead meet inside your labtop without any usage . Nice to have some
      experience working as a freelancer but believe me not enough as a junior. You
      have to practice more and more than usual. #GDLK \U0001F600\U0001F600"
