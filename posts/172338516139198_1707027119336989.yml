  For laravel geeks.
  Is it possible to set up a Task scheduler using Cron job to run a queue worker as a daemon on shared hosting. I know that is difficult but, is it possible?

      A daemon is a long running process. It all comes down to whether your hosting provider allows you to run long running processes.

      Sometimes you will need to upgrade your plan with the hosting provider in order to be able to do so.
