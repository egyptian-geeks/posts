  Is there any code editor that allow remote connecttion :o ? Realtime multiple connection

  looking for a way to do simple code-review remotely, sometime I need to be included in a remote session with a remote peer to check progress on project, or give a quick review on code, propose change etc.. so we navigate multiple files in his project, may be edit few lines here and there before he commit to GitHub.
  currently I use teamviewer to access remote machine and launch sublime overthere n . But it would be nice if we just use a plugin for sublime/vscode/atom to do so but I'm not aware if such feature exists

    message: Most of the editors support editing files remotely over SSH. Atom is
      one example.

      thanks all, I was looking for a way to do simple code-review remotely, sometime I need to be included in a remote session with a remote peer to check progress on project, or give a quick review on code, propose change etc.. so we navigate multiple files in his project, may be edit few lines here and there before he commit to GitHub.
      currently I do this by team-viewer but was hoping for a better workflow

    message: I believe the correct way to do so is by using correct branching strategy
      and do code review on the ticket branch then once satisfied with the changes
      you can accept merging it to main branch. Gitlab is a good web based plugin
      for  doing code reviews and managing merge requests and it can integrate with
      continuos integration tools like Jenkins as well.
