    message: "Hello Mohammed, thank you very much for the kind offer. This would be
      great and I am very interested. \n.\nI started studying to be a full stack web
      developer 3 months ago. First I finished studying the first 12 chapters(300+
      pages) in the book titled  \"Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript WITH jQUERY, CSS
      & HTML5\" which are about web development using php and mysql. I made a GitHub
      account and uploaded some simple projects:\n.\nhttps://github.com/Abdalla-wd
      \n. \nThen I started to study html and css. I have finished the two courses
      related to html and css from Elzero web school youtube channel (the html course
      was composed of 24 videos and the css course contained 29 video). Then I finished
      the practical application course from the same youtube channel which involved
      coding a full website in html and css (16 videos) [titled: Creating A Website
      From Preview [ Html, Css Lv1 ]. After this I finished the wireframing course
      also from the same channel - 7 videos).\n.\nThen I watched and applied with
      Abdalla Eid's course titled \"دورة بناء سكريبت منتدى بالكامل\" which is a 149
      short videos course that focuses on building a web forum using Php, mysql and
      html. After that I finished a short course in Abdalla Eid's youtube channel
      called \"دورة كيف تحلل برنامجك\" about the stages of developing an application
      (20 short videos).\n.\nCurrently I am practicing Php and myql by following and
      applying with different project-based courses I have downloaded from youtube
      (shown in the photo included with this comment) and at the same time studying
      a web development course using bootstrap 3 from Elzero web school youtube channel
      (52 videos, about 13+ hours). After it, I am planning to make some websites
      using html, css, bootstrap with some back-end programming with php and mysql
      while studying javascript, and jquery.\n.\nMy aim is to have the full set of
      the skills I have listed in this personal website:\n.\nhttp://abdalla-wd.com/\n.\nI
      hope that you will consider me for this mentorship opportunity, and I am grateful
      for your time. Thanks a lot in advance.\n.\nBest regards,\n.\nAbdalla\n.\n(p.s.
      The applications in the GitHub are simple and little old compared to my studying,
      this is because after I made the first few, I found out that I need to practice
      php and mysql more before creating additional applications, and to learn some
      front end techniques better in addition to the backend techniques I already
      now and practice.  I am planning to add more applications and designs to the
      GitHub account in the few coming weeks in shaa Allah)."
