      http://www.sqlite.org/
      1- Embedded (no need to install a separate server)
      2- Faster than MySql
      3- The DB is 1 file

    message: yup, an embedded database is your best shot.. there's one implemented
      in Java, which would be perfect if you want something cross-platform.. there
      is H2 http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html.. also there is another famous
      choice, Apache Derby, but it is not as favorable as H2..

    message: If the database is only gonna be used by this application and not shared
      by any other apps or services, so you are basically looking for a fancy file
      format in which case Sqlite is perfect

    message: This depends on what you want from database engine. If what you need
      is a simple database with basic functionality I recommend you use "SQLite" It
      is perfect for small applications, no server needed, high preformance. MySQL
      is great but it needs a server and might not be suitable for small applications.
