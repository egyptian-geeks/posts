      Thank you very much for this link! :)
      I've know about depth-first search (very easy) and deduced how breadth-first search would work, I studied Dijkstra a few times but in a confusing way (we studied it for routing in networks), and I always felt like A* is that really crazy thing that would be impossible to understand.
      ... and now I understood all of them in a few minutes =)

    message: yeah, professors make it sound hard, a friend of mine once wrote a post
      explaining pruning (for board game AIs) in a simple way, it was the first time
      for me to notice that these stuff aren't as hard as they seem :)

  - description: In games we often want to find paths from one location to another.
      A* is a commonly recommended algorithm. Breadth First Search, Dijkstra’s Algorithm,
      and A* are graph search algorithms that use the same basic structure. They represent
      the map as a graph and then find a path in that graph. If you ha…
