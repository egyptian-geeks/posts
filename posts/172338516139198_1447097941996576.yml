      MacBooks are terrible choice if you're going to do Android.
      But in case of iOS, early 2015 8Ram i5 is sufficient and cheaper.
      xCode is too smooth on that machine
       (BTW I did not try the 2016 version  with iOS)

    message: MacBook airs are very underpowered and also very old, I think the last
      one came out more than 3 years ago or so, and the new MacBook is also underpowered
      made for business users. I think MacBook Pros are the way to go
