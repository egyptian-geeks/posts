  I'm a web developer who works mainly on PHP projects. I'm gonna have a lot of spare time ahead and I want to learn a new language or improve myself in the ones i know, Could you suggest me what to do ? Here's what's in my head:

  1. Learn JavaScript design patterns
  2. Learn Python then Django (I have a background in Python)
  3. Learn C++ (I had a background a while ago)
  4. ?

      can have a good long term effect on your skills.

      I'd suggest you stick with web development stuff.

      Check out Ruby (Ruby the language, followed by Ruby on Rails) or NodeJS

      The below is a guidance, not a plan. Add or remove what you like

      1- General: Design, Cryptograohy/Security, TDD, CI
      2- DBs: Postgres, Mongo
      3- Techniques for realtime web (websockets, SSE, sockjs, ...)
      4- Front-end libs & frameworks (Angular, React, Polymer, SASS, )
      5- message queues: 0mq, RabbitMQ, ...

      then, you can get into nodejs, django, rails, or golang

      +1 for django i'm playing with it the last days and loved it. try flask too if you're willing to go with python.
      try to get dirty hands with some big data and try hadoob and elasticsearch (btw i'm a big fan with elasticsearch it save alot  of time spend on search optimization you can try elastica for php).
      try to get some badges on hackerranck and some fame on stackoverflow (da lw fdelak wa2t tany b3d kol dah :D).
