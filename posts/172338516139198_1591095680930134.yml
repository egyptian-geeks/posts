      - Although as a programmer you're supposed to be a nerd, but you have to be able to negotiate and sell yourself (as an employee, freelancer, entrepreneur, ...) or else you won't get what you deserve (money, freedom, creativity, ...). I fought so hard against this for a long time but I think that was a mistake.
      - As a good programmer (among some other professions) you're supposed to optimize for the worst case scenario in your code, but don't transfer that to your life and career choices, life is way more complicated than the most complicated code you'll ever write so you should be more optimistic, look the positive side and hope for the best (unlike good coding where you look at the negative and optimize for the worst) if you don't you WILL live in the worst case scenario.

    message: I wouldn't change anything. Every struggle I had, every failure I suffered,
      every single hard/good moment I've been through, shaped who I and contributed
      to what I achieved today.. and I am satisfied with what I've become and what
      I am achieving. الحمد لله
