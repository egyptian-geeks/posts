  Good afternoon, this is my first time posting here and I'm doing so in hopes of finding some advice or guidance.

  I'm a third-year computer sciences major, until last semester I didn't really have an idea as to what I'd like to specialize in once I graduate yet now I'm suddenly thinking about way too many things all at once. One area I've been trying to explore this semester is Data Science, I think it's something I might be interested in though I do have a couple of concerns.

  Firstly, I've done my research and have a good idea as to what exactly goes into Data Science in terms of big data and machine learning and so on. However one aspect that made me hesitant to go further into it is the mathematics involved, I failed to properly gather exactly how much math goes in it or how good a person must be actually at math to be a data scientist, I do understand my fair share of maths but it's not my strong suit and would not want it to hinder me while trying to learn data science. So if anyone can tell me if a person can be successful in this field without being something of a mathematical prodigy, it would be much obliged.

  Secondly, again from the people I've talked to and the research I've done so far it seems like Python and R are already packed with thousands of packages and algorithms for anything that someone might need while working on a project, the thing is I've always preferred to write my own algorithms/classes or at least modify existing ones. So I was wondering if there was room for much or any creativity in a field like this.

  Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance to any and all responders.

    message: If you wanna know what's going on under the hood you need to be good
      in  probability and statistics and some linear algebra and ( basic calculus
      ) this will help you to be able to read papers and of course will enable you
      to invent new methods otherwise if you wanna Know just the application you would
      need some ( basic probability) and linear algebra
