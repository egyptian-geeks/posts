  The Lumia phones simply weren’t selling, and while I certainly know a number of

      The problem I see is that they had multiple chances to reproduce a better OS for mobiles but they didn't.
      Once they bought Nokia they were supposed to do something new with Nokia but they didn't, they bought a losing company and no action has been taken. I read an article that Satya was against this move and he was right.
