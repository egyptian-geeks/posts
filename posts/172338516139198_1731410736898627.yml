message: Hey everyone, which resources do you recommend *for a teen* who wants to
  learn programming from scratch :) Preferably, it should be in Arabic or at least
  with Arabic subtitles. It is fine if it isn't free.

    message: Would recommend "Logo" programming language for kids.. not sure if there
      are suitable material in Arabic. But for this age and as one learning from scratch
      having a personal teacher / mentor would be needed.

    message: I think the best way to start is with something that involves software/hardware
      interaction. I would recommend BBC's Micro:Bit for that. She can use scratch
      with it first, then JavaScript and Python as she moves on. It's also expandable.
      The kit comes with examples and many more available on sites like instructable.
      If you are in the UAE like the picture suggests, then Sharaf DG probably has
      them. If not Pimoroni could ship to you from the UK for a flat shipping rate.
