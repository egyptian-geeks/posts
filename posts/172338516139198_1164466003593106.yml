message: If I want to make a library  ( jar, gem, pip .. etc ). And this library has
  a key/value based data. What is the best solution for the best performance? storing
  them in a json/xml file then loading all the file in the memory for every query
  is هبل. Storing the data on a server with an API is good choice but it will be an
  opensouce project and I won't pay for ther server forever I want it to be stable
  and trusted by the user. what do you think ??? SQLite??
