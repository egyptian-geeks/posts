    message: "1.There is no useless effort in searching for jobs.. At least you learn
      .. It is just you don't stop at dropping your CV their and stay home waiting
      ...\n\n2. If you mean the CV applied on the job website of Google or Amazon
      or whatever ... The answer is yes if you are not in middle East and you did
      a very professional cv. \n\nIf you are in Egypt or Middle East the only way
      is to be referred by a friend who knows that you are good ... Or if you are
      still a student is to join programming contests such as ACM ACPC .. Or if you
      have missed this opportunity then to shine on contests websites such as topcoder
      and codeforces .... Etc"

      Google does check the resumes submitted on their website, at least for internships. I know those who got interviews just by submitting their resumes there.
      But for sure you'll more likely get an interview if you've been referred by someone who works there.

      Every job application counts, regardless of whatever they check it or not, you learn what's in the market and what companies are looking for

      For big corporate, in Egypt internal referrals seems to work more than applying directly; and it's almost the same abroad, but I was surprised when I received a call for interview from Google by just applying directly without any referrals nor even a standing CV from a junior applicant back then 8 years ago; but this didn't happen again when I applied recently at Wikipedia and Google again

    message: "Yes they do check them, and I got replies from applying online for Google.
      But referrals are waaaaaaaay faster and more reliable when it comes to big companies
      because of the massive amount of applications. \n\nStartups however are faster
      and do check their online submissions, udacity for example (where I now work)
      pride themselves of replying within 48 hours max"
