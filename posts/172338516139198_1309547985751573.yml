message: "I apologize in advance for the prolonged post.\nI need a fast track (Framework,
  IDE, methodology ) for developing mobile apps (geared towards prototyping) that
  satisfies the following :\n1-  The conceived prototype should be easy to implement
  and is not meant to be sold or commercially consumed as is. Performance and optimization
  are non factors really.\n2-It must be possible to build the final product using
  all or most of at least the business logic and the frontend. \n3-Scaleability is
  a must.\n4-Must be very very flexible\n5-Cloud ready. \nI think you have an idea
  of what I'm looking for. But here is the fun part. The suggested stack is meant
  to be used by a small team of web developers who are familiar .Net framework but
  willing to invest time and effort in something else BUT with minimum time/effort
  \nThank you  ."
