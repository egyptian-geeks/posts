    message: "You can test code efficiency by unit testing and white box techniques.
      \nUsually developer uses the happy scenarios to test his own code but the tester
      focus on negative and unexpected scenarios to break the code, testers may use
      blackbox techniques to simulate all probabilities that may happen with the end
      user\nTesting is context dependant testing strategies differs from project to
      other based on the objective and risk of project \n\nYou can join Egyptian testing
      geeks group to know more about testing \nWww.facebook.com/groups/EgyptianTestingGeeks"
