    message: 'I loved this article. My thoughts on it:  No one should hate themselves
      or become demotivated no matter what their skill level. A Class A JS developer
      is better than a Class D systems developer.  What you should do is something
      that ignites your passion, being a code monkey means doing mindless work, my
      solution to that in VB4-6 was to create a VB module that did the CRUD operations
      for me. In .NET I was working on a code generator. With JS, I always had an
      issue because I could never just mindlessly copy and paste, but I wanted to
      know how things work. But in the end, it is about your output, so if someone
      can copy and paste while producing better output than you, then you need to
      look at the bigger picture.  It is good to have a thirst for knowledge, but
      this whole sadness and depression is all based on the ego, it all starts by
      killing the ego. What you get after that is someone who enjoys life and has
      fun, while doing what is necessary. You get balance.  I personally hate JS,
      but because of the weaknesses I percieve in it, howver, I took this as a challenge
      to start learning it and writing GOOD js code, then work on producing beautiful
      things at my own pace. Just give up the ego and your goals will all fall in
      your lap.'
