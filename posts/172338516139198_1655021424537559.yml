  How can i estimate software development task in man hours?

  now working without a good approach estimation,
  and after search i found out classical methods.
  - Poker estimate,
  - Comparison to similar projects,
  - Bottom up & top down

    message: Humans are not good about estimation, that's why methodologies like pocker/magic
      estimation are used to define tasks in terms of complexity, and sometimes relative
      to well-known base task. It's measured in story points

    message: Divide your project into small development (coding) tasks, and estimate
      them based on similar/previous experience. And add around 40% on top of it to
      cover the design, deployment, and testing. Then add other overhead, like project
      management, communications, meetings, workshops, and on top of that add your
      contingency.
