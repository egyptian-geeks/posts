    message: "If you want a decent speakers then Homepod or Google home max, if you
      want a voice assistant only then google home. It also depends on the ecosystem
      \n\nP.S: I don’t think HomePod or Home Max are released so you’ll need to wait
      for hands on reviews. But at least we know that Google Assistant is far better
      than Siri"

    message: "Google Home for sure. \nSiri is inferior lol, it doesn't support multiple
      profiles using voice, only supports Apple Music and has no AUX or Bluetooth
      connectivity. it is simply inferior in the personal assistants category, It
      should be compared with home speakers not assistants."
