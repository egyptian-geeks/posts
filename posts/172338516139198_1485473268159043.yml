  Hello everyone,
  Have anyone tried this book on cryptography?
  http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783642041006
  Especially the math part if it's well explained.
  If you have other good resources for the number theory, groups, fields and such topics please comment with them it's helpful.

    message: Yes, it's a good book, haven't finished it all, but I go back to it every
      now and then. It doesn't dive too deep into the math, it usually describes the
      math but you won't see a page full of proofs

      I got this book too, it's a huge book that so far I wasn't brave enough to star

    message: "interesting!\nRegarding the book in the original post, if i am not that
      good in number theory and algebraic structures, does it suit me? \nIn other
      words is every mathematical part explained and self contained or i am gonna
      need some external resource for that part?"

      materials in 24 video lectures well explained in this Playlist Christof Paar
      - Introduction to Cryptography: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6N5qY2nvvJE8X75VkXglSrVhLv1tVcfy
      , I guess it would help clear any mathemtical confusions!'
