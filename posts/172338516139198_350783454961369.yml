  as we all know, you can't make cross-domain AJAX calls with jQuery, or any other alternative library.
  this is due to a concept called "same origin policy", and BTW this is a browser-level implementation, not with the technology that is being used.

  this plugin will fix this behavior in a VERY smart way, and will let you do this with ease.
  Give it a try, and let me know if you faced any problems.
  BTW, I've faced a problem when calling some Arabic content due to charset incompatibility, I've fixed this plugin to support Arabic and other non-Latin characters.

  I will post it and let you know soon ISA.

      Nice share Adel.
      my recent task (Chrome Extension project) will allow nothing more than JS, CSS, HTML. so I needed something that is client-side top-to-bottom, that's why I've invested some time and came up with the contents of this post.

      all the cross domain policies says that you can fetch data such as JSON from remote servers but they forgot to mention you need to have access to this server and allow the cross domain policy! so in fact this is useless! if you are trying with jquery may be you should try to use something like this:

      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open("GET", "http://dev.jquery.com/~john/xdomain/test.php", true);
      xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        if ( xhr.readyState == 4 ) {
          if ( xhr.status == 200 ) {
            document.body.innerHTML = "My Name is: " + xhr.responseText;
          } else {
            document.body.innerHTML = "ERROR";
          }
        }
      };
      xhr.send(null);

      Mohamed Alaa: I think this was something that Firefox has started to support from a couple of years ago, but I sincerely don't know if it's supported on other browsers or not.

      after looking around for sometime, I found that this type of calls was available only to extensions and trusted code within Firefox itself, right?
      let me check and you too, and let's post our finding here.

      but seriously, nice catch, like usual ;)

      requests, which would usually be prohibited due to the same-domain-policy. I
      already knew about YQL, but I had no idea that it allowed retrieval of HTML
      from other sites, via JSON, returned as a single string!
