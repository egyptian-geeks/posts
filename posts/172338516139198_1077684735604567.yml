    message: "In my own opinion, I believe you would learn a lot more from actually
      coding than from studying methodology (which CS106 is actually all about) \nI
      wouldn't advise taking CS106 now since you're not a college student, you'd quickly
      lose the information since they're not really that practical for you and you'd
      have wasted your time.\nBut, if you have some free time that you don't know
      what to do with it, then enroll in CS106."
