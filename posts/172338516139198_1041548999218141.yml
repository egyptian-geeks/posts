  Guys if you manage a lot of servers and tired of keeping track of all their users ips and ports. check out https://github.com/GomaaK/sshez
  It still needs some development work to include more advanced features but it is ok for normal usage. Your feedback/contributions are highly appreciated.

      but it is just much easier this way

    message: I love having 1 liners that makes my life easier. I would never prefer
      editing maintaining a file by myself. I'm what you can call a lazy developer.
      I think this one is for lazy developers that want to automate everything they
      do.

      And here the first one using sed too, less ugly than using cut:

      function ssh-add { echo $2 | sed -e "s/\(.*\)@\(.*\):\(.*\)/%Host $1%^User \1%^HostName \2%^Port \3/" | tr % "\n" | tr ^ "\t" >>~/.ssh/config};

    message: it's worth mentioning that automating even the simplest and most trivial

      tools used are basically a personal preference...

    message: This is clearly a terminal utility, why is it in your README do you hint
      at the possibility that it could be used as a library by suggesting one can
      put it in a Gemfile? Does it expose any public interfaces and if so why aren't
      they documented?
