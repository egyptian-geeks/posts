  Not a Good News, our website www.kenrys.com got hacked and we managed to clean it.

  Here is the issue for all of you guys to take care:

  Check your wordpress website for the following:
  1- Installed Plugin called "SEO Advisor"
  2- In the plugins directory, any strange plugin folder like "Wordpress Researchers" or other not identified names.
  3- Strange Tables in the WP DB like "wp_cont, wp_core_log"
  4- Check your users and if there is any user added.
  5- New posts published under you website and they will not appear under posts section in the Dashboard.

  to make sure just do a search on google for all indexed urls example: "site:kenrys.com"

  If you found anything from the above, then your website got hacked.

  To clean it you have to do the following steps:

  1- Take a backup (yes from the infected website, you might lose all content during the cleaning process - from database & files).

  2- Remove all unwanted plugins (mentioned above), you might end up with a broken website, don worry if you found error regarding a plugin called xcalendar, then go edit the wp-config file and remove the line that call that plugin.

  3- Install a security plugin like "Wordfence". and do a scan.
  4- Go to database using "phpmyadmin" and search post in the wp_posts table, and delete the inserted posts.
  5- Change all passwords, admin, database and even ftp or cpanel pass.
  6- Make sure your wordpress and all plugins are updated.
  7- Install a 404 redirect plugin to make use of the fake links as traffic ;)
  8- Take another backup from the clean version.

  Good luck, If you need any help, please let me know.
