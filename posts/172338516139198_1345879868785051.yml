  Does anyone know of any way to download dmg file for MacOS from Windows?
  My macOS is gone and I need to create a bootable USB to reinstall it but can't find a single working link to download the dmg file

      i had the same issue before
      try rebooting into recovery mode, connect your device to internet and download MacOs
      the alternative you send your device for TradeLine stores or any apple authorised retailer to install one for you
      don't try to download dmg, they need to be made for your device
