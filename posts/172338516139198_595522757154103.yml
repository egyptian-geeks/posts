    message: the user experience you can do it and you don't need jquery at all. what
      i love about this validation plugin is that it doesn't have any dependencies
      (Pure JS) and you can customize it as you wish. normally the jQuery plugins
      offers you more than what you need and you Tax the website visitor by loading
      a plugin that you only need small parts of it and the rest is just living out
      there :)

      of the time the user browser have it(JQuery) from other websites \n& regarding
      the user experience, why do i bother my self coding stuff already done ?"

      you shouldn't bother your self coding stuff are already done. it depends on your use case. if you are working on a small project use as much as jquery plugins hahahaha but if you want to build a maintainable website and well documented code that can help people after you to understand everything without the need to go to a jquery plugin page you won't use jQuery plugins.

      Another reason is why to have a plugin that might or might not work in the next jquery release or even after 5 releases while you use pure javascript and you willnever worry about updating it ;)

    message: the second reason is rational but the first i think is not (as large
      websites/systems uses JQuery & there is no problem with that)

    message: yes they use jQuery but mostly they use for small tasks not for stacking
      plugins out there. if you look at all the new Javascript technologies Node,
      Backbone or even AngularJS you will see that we are returning back to use pure
      js in a better way. jQuery actually was made for people (was like me) who hated
      javascript and just needed to be able to do cool javascript stuff like sliders,
      lightbox, ajax, etc...

      @ all & then may be the browsers it self will include JQuery with the browser

      seems not !"
