  as a fresh student in computer science,I find out that I almost have zero technological awareness in general and in the field particularly ,I used to deal with it just as a user.
  I try to involve with geek ,expert communieties even if I dont understand the talk but to hear some terms and trying to understand them with myself.
  Any advice?

    message: Then learn a web framework based on Python like Django, or maybe ASP.NET
      core based on C#, make sure you lose your shyness of changing programming languages.
      , see past the syntax into the OO concepts and design patterns. Know MVC like
      a pro so you can do web development in any platform. Always keep Java handy
      as well on eclipse

    message: Do all of that from a laptop with Linux installed so you can learn the
      basic bash commands and the use of docker containers along the way. Plus with
      Linux, you don't have to use a lot of system resources to get your environment
      up and running and not so much disk space. Favour an SSD over RAM for your laptop.
      With Linux even 4 GB Ram is sufficient, 8 GB is better, but you won't feel as
      much load on your system as windows
