    message: 'Hey man, I can help. There are multiple tracks within the security field.
      The main tracks are: offensive (penetration test) , defensive (digital forensics
      and incident handling) and grc ( governance, risk and compliance). You can be
      in a job where u will do all three but you will have to focus on one eventually.
      Based on you preference I can guide on which books to read and which certificates
      to take. A general advice is to know the basics of: networks, systems (windows
      , Linux...etc) and applications (desktop and web)'
