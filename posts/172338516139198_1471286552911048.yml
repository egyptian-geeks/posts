      Yes, even on Windows 8 and 8.1
      You don't need a 3rd party anti virus, the built in up to date windows defender is more than enough, plus some common sense in avoiding cracked software or pirated content which is the number one source of all things evil.

    message: Comdo Firewall got an antivirus feature if you wish to enable it but
      I do not, Malwarebytes is not auto scanning anything only when I wish it to
      do and I am living a peaceful life :)

    message: Windows defender is ok if you are not going to buy an antivirus (it is
      about as good as the free stuff when you take into account bundled crapware
      and usability issues with the free antiviruses). However a real antivirus such
      as kaspersky would be better if you are willing to pay.

      I'd recommend bitdefender, the free edition.
      I think it's the best free antivirus, and it's light on almost any system.
