  A #review about  #Ember #knockout #Backbone #Vue #react in comparison to #angular1 and #angular2
  =================================
  Knockout, Backbone
  Both get the work done, but they are outdated solutions compared to angular n Vuejs.
  =================================
  Ember
  modern framework, has a lovely CLI, a lot better than the previous ones, but, we didn't click, so moving on :D
  =================================
  Vuejs
  i loved it, a 16kb framework that accomplishes everything u need in a frontend framework with the best declarative approaches, it's so simple, u can learn it in 2 hour max. it felt like a mix between the good stuff in angular 1 n angular2... it's a lot better than angular1 and it has a lovely debugging tool!
  I would use it for websites and small webapps, yet, not as powerful as angular2 of course!
  =================================
  React
  WTFFFFFFFFFFFF, it's freaking ugly, if there's an election between react and angular2, elderly people will elect React, that's how i feel about it :D
  =================================
  angular1.x
  it's has been 6 years, thank u for ur services, i would say it's gonna be around for more 4 years, i wouldn't build any new apps with it unless it's a low budget or short-term project!
  =================================
  angular2
  way more futuristic than all of them, it's the best ecosystem for you as a developer and the best output for your users, i'm totally investing my next few months mastering it!

    message: "I started using VueJS 4 months ago.\nAt first I started learning Angular
      but it was hard to me to understand its architecture because it was the first
      time to me to use a front-end framework (I don't know how were I maintain the
      code without a framework!)\nVue x, router,  resource, i18n made the job easier
      :D \nAnd now a lot of things in Angular become clear after using Vue! \U0001F602
      \n\nI think someday I would try Angular2 as currently it would be a bad decision
      to migrate"

    message: You have to dig more into react this the initial impression for everyone,
      after awhile you will get used to it and you will start to believe it's THE
      WAY to build UIs and start to convince everybody why they should use it, just
      like me :D
