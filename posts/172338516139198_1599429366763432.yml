  Hello guys .. I've just learned that augmented reality libraries exists now like ARKit and ARCore .. I am interested in learning the basics in any one of them .. anyone interested to start this learning curve with me?!!
  I've just checked the ARCore and it seems it requires OpenGL ES .. luckily I have a decent experience with it .. but I am not an android developer myself  .. and I need motivation :D .. who wants to waste some of his precious time on this topic :D ??
