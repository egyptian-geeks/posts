    message: Depends on the application size! Sure for me I will use Microsoft ASP.NET
      Stack and based on the project requirement & size I will choose either asp.net
      mvc or web forms. If it's an enterprise application with some CMS I will go
      for MS SharePoint

      My latest project used this stack

      Python Flask as web platform
      SQLAlchemy for ORM
      MySQL DB
      Knockout.JS for front end
      Linux server \ nothing prevents it from running on Windows though

      I liked the Python Flask model of very thin plugins, so you can always only use what you need.

      Ayman Mahfouz That really depends on what are you integrating with. SOA? REST? Maybe you're given access to a message broker, an ESB. Maybe it follows the unix philosophy.
      Legacy system integration usually comes in with a lot of variables.  What about your new system, it has requirements as well.
