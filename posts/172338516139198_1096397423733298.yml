message: "Question guys how can FB know that I know someone and suggest him to me.
  \nwho is in another country, never met in person, never been in the same geographical
  location together, no mutule friends, our only correspondence is through the my
  company's mail and Lync servers.\nIs having the same company name as place of work
  given that they are not exact, enough? \nPlease share your thoughts\n\nEdit: I log
  to FB from inside the company vpn network can that be something used for linking
  us?"

    message: I've had the same question for sometime now, FB keeps suggesting people
      who have absolutely nothing that links them to me except a phone book entry
      may be. then it occurred to me, they are probably using the FB mobile app which
      has mostly used their phone contacts to figure out the connection. I cannot
      see it any other way.
