      1- Do you have a job offer in Ireland?
      2- Are you in Egypt?

      If your answer is "yes" to both, Go, then share your experience!

      If your answer to #1 is "no", then you need to make it a "yes", and then share your experience.

      Good and bad people exist everywhere.

      The experience and growth you gain by living somewhere else is priceless.

      And yes, living in most other countries, including Ireland, is probably, better than living in Egypt, for now.

      I wish you good luck! :)

      bloody do is drink, and a lot of it!! \U0001F602 for the people who ask why
