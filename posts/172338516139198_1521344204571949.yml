  we are considering opening internships in our company.

  As our company expands, we found our self wasting lots of time and energy in headhunting and scouting to expand our staff. as we have failed to manage the very high turnover rate; the team keep shrinking with all good/experienced developers keep migrating out of country - and I cannot blame them-

  so we are considering if opening up for paid internship in our company can be of any benefit for business ? you know taking in young dev. teaching them new skills, assigning them tasks using such skills, and use output in production. step by step incremental course setup.. etc..

  anyone have Goan down this road before ?
  how did it benefit/affected your company growth ?

  I'm a little worried if it will be cost effective to invest in such area. I want to do it but I'm in fear of risks and r.o.i., not sure how much budget should be allocated for this specially that you will have to compensate both the mentor and the intern.

  ----Note----
  there are international regulations that strict and applies to any fellowship program, and I'm well aware of them so please dont comment with things like "u will abuse them, they will not benefit, etc.. negative thoughts..", I'm not asking for tips to abuse younger generation. I'm asking for your experience IF you have experienced a well constructed internship program before. and how was it working for the company

      Good students will be eager to learn and are willing to accomplish. I find them adding value to the place they work at. That being said, you have to hire/find the "good students" who will fit to your team.
      They can also be good candidates for future openings in your company. To sum, I find internships a win-win.

    message: Another thought,,you can sponsor a graduation project. Students will
      get real world hands on experience, and I believe many colleges will welcome
      the idea.

    message: I think it's all about handpicking your interns. There are some college
      kids right now with a lot of knowledge and crazy potential. If you can get your
      hands on those then it's definitely worth the venture.

    message: I think Ahmad Alfy can write more details but we have tailored an internship
      program a couple of years ago, applied it, and we have like 5-10 awesome engineers
      working full time now @ robusta because of that one program. It was a huge success
      in my humble opinion.
