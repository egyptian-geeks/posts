  The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in US and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers. It was created by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed on January 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.

  The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.

      and if you need to impliment it in javascript this is the fastest Algorithm I have found so far (0.059ms): https://gist.github.com/ShirtlessKirk/2134376

      And this is benchmark results:
      http://jsperf.com/credit-card-validator/7

      Good luck :)
