    message: we had a startup exhibit there , it was very very bad , the organization
      was disastrous, we had a very bad experience with the crowd due to exhaustion
      cause no roof and the sun, none of the promised tours were done ,and we did
      all the heavy lifting , even connecting to WIFI was a nightmare and we lost
      the connection at mid day and we had to apologize for the visitors that the
      life demonstration was not available, needless to say the paperless approach
      were unsupervised correctly and we lost a lot of contacts because of it "our
      main goal from the summit" , as for the workshops and deep dives were a whole
      another domain of failure , a lots of collision and mis-match timing  , workshops
      canceled at last minute and time schedule was mediocre at best ,as for the security
      now that was a fun topic as the security neglected to register our equipment
      during entering and locked us in when were going out because the equipment's
      were not registered and we had to contact the chief of campus security to get
      out after standing nearly 12 hours in the sun and the heat and the pitching
      and the frustration meter was at max , we were at our limit, the only good side
      that there were a lot of promising people and networking was a bit nicer than
      the rest, as for the investor meeting at the hotel that was another hell , they
      served alcohol to Muslims and they had no distinction of what or how is going
      on ,i have a friend was there as an investor was very troubled by the scene
      and the hosts did not have the finesse to manage it through and barely took
      notice, my evaluation 1/10 , and i dont think we will be attending again ,techni
      summit was 100 times better .

      As an attendee I loved the networking and the booths not the talks.
      As a designer I only went to meet Chris Do

    message: I didn't this year. But from previous years i can say it can be good
      if you have a free ticket. But for a paid summit, NOT at all cheap btw, you're
      most likely to be disappointed.
