      this is the second post I see talking about something like that in less than
      a week.

      just for a growing a better community ... for example when I lose rep. in stackoverflow I feel so bad and try to write the next question/answer in more detailed and obvious way ...
      I envy them their enthusiasm building a great community ... and teaching n00bs how to-dos .. so they turn Pro.'s in a shorter time !

    message: As far as I understand, this is not what this group is about. I wouldn't
      expect any recognition if I was able to help someone. SO is about making the
      best help (eco)system for coders. This group is about helping "Egyptian geeks"
      find each other and connect. I could be wrong.

      rules like no job posting and no trivial questions. But this line of thinking
      is just one more step towards making this group hostile and judgemental.

      No, I think the group is about exchanging opinions. If you agree with someone like him, if you disagree comment, if you think its place is not here, report it.
      Adding a reputation system to something like this, wouldn't mean that someone's contributions are useful, just that he is most average and many people identify with what he writes (and therefore +1 him).

      But yes, this isn't particularly difficult to do. Search for Greasemonkey if you want to see similar things in action (You will need a server to store rep though).

      Ahmed Fatoum said everything I wanted to say. This group is for exchange between peers. Ranking people doesn't mix with "peers". Ranking content is already built in.

      Technically also I cannot expect to ask thousands of members to use specific hack or browser extension to use the group. That's just not gonna happen.
