      There are a lot of of inaccurate information in here. Like suggesting that setTimeout is a security risk.

      Also the time of the video (2014) tells in a few places, like rejecting TypeScript just because it's from Microsoft.

      One important thing to notice too is that this is from a Scala conference, so, it's biased by definition.

      It'll be very hard for a Node newbie to tell the correct parts, and the intermediate developer will likely be familiar with the correct pain point and might stare at the rest.

      It's probably a good one for those exploring Play, but not for those evaluating Node.
