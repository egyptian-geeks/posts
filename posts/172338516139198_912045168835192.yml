    message: Guys, it makes sense architecturally, Python is interpreted, can be designed,
      and architected well, has many libraries, is a superior language overall, so
      basically all you need if to get the interpretter with FF, Chrome and you got
      yourself a cross platform language. Also, it can manipulate markup and it can
      be easily debugged. so instead of a browser executing a .JS file line by line,
      it will execute a .py file line by line. It will be faster and possibly even
      allow access to the hardware if needed (despite the security risk.) Sounds like
      a great deal to me
