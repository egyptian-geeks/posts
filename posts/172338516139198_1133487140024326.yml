  A while ago, Google photos announced the "People" feature. It groups all the faces in your photos so that they become searchable. The feature is not enabled in all countries, but I wanted to give it try. With a quick googling I found the link below. It mentions that it's currently working in the US and a VPN will get it working. I installed the "Hola Free VPN" app on my mobile, opened google photos with the VPN enabled ( without clearing the app's data ) and the "Group similar faces" switch appeared in the settings! I enabled it, waited for a while and it worked. It detected all the faces in all the photos I took since I started using Google photos. It's amazingly accurate. It's one of the most amazing features I've ever tried. Also for those who don't know, you can search your photos with keywords like "food", "selfies", "screenshots", etc. Google photos is just awesome. Give it a try, it's worth it.
  Note: Once the switch appears, you don't need the VPN anymore.
