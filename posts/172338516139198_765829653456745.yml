    message: "There's really nothing technically limiting about Linux, it's just an
      industry direction that started a decade or two ago and never really started
      to change until recently.\n\nPlayers that are interested in high-end titles
      are mostly either owners of a gaming console or PC/Mac users. AAA titles cost
      millions of dollars in production, marketing and distribution. \nGame studios
      and game publishers need to cater to markets that are willing to buy their games
      and for long the Linux user base has been (wrongly) perceived as non-gamers.\n\nThere
      has also been a lot of debates with regards to commercial software licenses
      on Linux, lots of wrong perceptions about the spirit behind the OSS movement
      and the lack of support from hardware vendors and chip manufacturers.\nCompanies
      like Nvidia only recently started playing nice with distro vendors."

      Linux is also known to work extremely well on low-end machines, so the consensus amongst industry experts is, if you're on Linux, you're likely there because your work demands it, your hardware is not too powerful and you're not too keen on paying for software.

      Linux also plays well with others, you can dual boot Linux and Windows, Linux and OSX which is something Windows and OSX aren't too nice about.

      So when you look at the consumer base, you'll find more end users on Windows and Mac, more power users on Linux/Unix and dual booting isn't rocket science. It only makes sense on a business front to support consoles, PCs and Macs
