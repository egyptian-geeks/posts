message: "Hey everyone, my laptop (lenovo z570 with a couple of upgrades) is failing
  fast (in terms of MB failures, outer chaises ugly screen resolution.... :D), and
  I believe it's about time for a new one. However, the issue is, with my second gen
  core-i5, 8GB of RAM, and a recently bought Samsung SSD on my current system, I'm
  generally satisfied and most of the available laptops I've seen don't really look
  like a true upgrade. So, I started considering a Mac Book Pro... and then I started
  wondering if there are better choices that I can buy for >15K. I'm pretty sure the
  PC world has a lot to offer for that price range. so, simply put, the question is,
  why should/shouldn't I buy a mac, and if not a mac, which laptop do you recommend
  for running ubuntu (sorry windows guys, unless I'm running OS X, there is nothing
  else I can use other than Linux :D) \n\n--p.s. I know it's a controversial thing,
  and some people take it so religiously, but I need to buy a new laptop not start
  a flame war :P"

      kol el Mac owners can't see any better thing to do with their hardly earned
      bucks, there must be something that makes people choose a Mac over a PC, I want
      to know that "thing", maybe I'll agree with it and start wondering how I've
      been living without a mac all this time, and maybe not, hence is my question
      :)

    message: It's supposed to have a much longer battery life, an SSD HDD and the
      os is really good. For me, only the battery is worth getting a mac as I prefer
      a FOSS OS.

    message: Ok, now you have a reason to buy a mac, is that reason worth that much
      difference in price? Also check the availability and the status of the hardware
      drivers in linux distros in case you wanted to dual boot.

      1- Mac performance surpass expectations, (no lag time when switching between apps/desktops, building your app
      2-typically no need to shutdown your mac :) just close the lid, then open it and voila! You're back in the game
      3- Operating system flexibility and brilliant indexing performance
      4- did I mention no viruses (nearly) or malware or any similar hassle?
      5- battery serves you right (8 hours average! Depends of course on what you do)

      Finally, I used to be a PC user since DOS and Win 3.11, I bought my MacBookPro (MBP) 6 months ago, I panicked after I bought it for 2 days, then a smile pops over my face every time I use my laptop (seriously), and since then my daily routine includes cursing Bill Gates!

      Go for it bro

    message: Not sure of the price, but the DELL XPS 15 is nice, if you get the top
      model, or the middle model and use your own SSD. Another good option is Lenovo
      T40. You might also check the 13" Horizon / Celvo (the brand name differs per
      country).

    message: Although I don't buy most of the claims about the Mac, it's good hardware
      for Windows. Now with newly released MBPr 15, you might be able to get the highest
      spec of the late 2013 model for good price.
