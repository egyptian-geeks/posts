  What do you guys think of certbot (Let's encrypt)? I used it and got my green https lock in 5 minutes for free. I mean it's one of those things that are too good to be true :-D
  Do you think there's a catch or is the era of expensive ssl certificates is just over?

      I'm a Certbot contributor, glad you're using it! :D

      For now, Let's Encrypt supports only domain validation (DV) (and not organization validation (OV) or extended validation (EV)). Let's Encrypt is sponsored by EFF, Chrome, Firefox, Akamai, and many others. I think that's enough proof to make it true :D

      As Mostafa mentioned, such really expensive certificates (probably $100+) validate not only the domain itself but also the organization, and that requires legal paperwork. That has been discussed multiple times but it isn't considered yet.
