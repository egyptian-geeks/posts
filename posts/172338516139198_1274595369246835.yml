    message: In a nutshell, dynamic language with C like Syntax and with functional
      programming features. That will be Javascript, Java, C#. Throw in a framework
      for the frontend and one for the backend and you could say your programming
      in the same language anyway :)

      I think it's one of the most long living languages for the next 25 years or may be more.
      You can build any kind of applications with it.

      a headache, tests in non strict syntax in a nightmare\n\nconclusion: love it

    message: IMO There is no language is a main language, it depends on what you want
      to do.  What you like to develop. The thing about js is u can code frontend
      and backend with it, but it might not be ur first backend choice for many reasons.
      My advice would be to know in which area you would like to develop or specialize
      first. At the end full stack developers cant know about backend as much as backend
      engineers do. Plus i dont think i have seen big companies offering full stack
      positions either backend or frontend or whatsoever .. all the best
