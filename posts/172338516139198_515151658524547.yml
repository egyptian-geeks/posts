      i like better the: Unix philosophy

      Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
      Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
      Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
      Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
      Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
      Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
      Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
      Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
      Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.[4]
      Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
      Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
      Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
      Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
      Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
      Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
      Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for "one true way".
      Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.

  - description: Architects look at thousands of buildings during their       training,
      and study critiques of those buildings written       by masters. In contrast,
      most software developers only       ever get to know a handful of large programs       well—usually
      programs they wrote       themselves—and never stud...
