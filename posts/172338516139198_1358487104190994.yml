      Actually i do not fully understand your request , do you want to rent it ? in this case , go ahead , buy some cheap VPS / Cloud (Centos or Ubuntu) , install GUI (Gnome is the best , keep away from KDE) on it along with vnc-server , and use a VNC viewer client (exist for both windows and linux) to remotely access it . in case you want to install the OS at your own PC/Lap , you may download and install Centos /Ubuntu with GNOME , and as mentioned above , use a VNC viewer client to access it from any other device (even your mobile device) , This may help :

      then do the coding locally using your preferred IDE.
