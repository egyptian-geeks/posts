  Is it possible to physically place any monitor vertically? Even if it doesn't have that option built-in?
  All I could find on Google is people trying to fix their accidentally-flipped monitor from Windows.

      to get monitors' ports
      $ xrandr -q
      to change monitor rendering
      $ xrandr --output PORT --rotate REND

      change PORT from results of 1st cmd, then REND = {normal|left|right|inverted}

    message: I really didn't get the question are you asking if "all the manufactured
      monitors" could be placed vertically? is that the question? because that doesn't
      make sense to me at all, I mean every monitor has it's own design and case if
      it's designed to have multiple setup then let it be, if designers designed it
      to be horizontal then we can't do anything about it unless you  support it in
      a hacky way to remain vertically, and it sure depends on what kind of monitor
      you have.
