    message: I completely disagree ... Github is not a bug tracking or issue reporting
      or support system ... Maybe find a way to integrate Github issues with other
      ticketing systems or anything similar ...

    message: Ahmad Alfy I think Github issues are a de facto way of communicating
      with Open Source Project maintainers, and it is the first place anyone checks
      before using a new open source project or library.

    message: Before that you had to use mailing lists or forums or IRC channels or
      Bugzilla which is an overkill for most projects

      from my point of view  Github is "a project"  and users are going to ask for more features or some enhancements. its not about if Github is a bug tracking or not.
      Maybe they think in that way: "why would i keep using your software if it's not provide me features that keeps me satisfied." and then they may move to GitLab

    message: "Everyone seems to focus on the ticking and issues aspect, completely
      ignoring one serious problem. PRs and contributor guidelines. If we'd have an
      OSS hub, I'd actually appreciate if they solved this problem. \n\nAfter all,
      open source software is only as successful as its community of contributors,
      if i'm maintaining a project and have to go through highs and lows reviewing
      PRs that aren't following the project's contribution guidelines i'll certainly
      burn out."
