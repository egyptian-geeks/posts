message: I have a problem that I can't concentrate at all in open offices. Some people
  try to put on earbuds and listen to songs, others listen to instrumental no-lyrics
  stuff, I tired both, but nothing worked. I still really distracted, and  my productivity
  is not high at all. Any Advice, please?

    message: I have a similar problem. I usually use white/natural noise generators
      - surprisingly effective at blocking out surrounding noise. There's an android
      app (from Relaxio I think) that has presets for rain, thunderstorms, distant
      traffic, .. etc. with separate volume controls so you can "mix". And there are
      plenty of websites and youtube listings for similar stuff also.

    message: If you mean that your problem is not only about blocking audio noise,
      but you may also need to block visual noise then may be try to get a big screen,
      or change your office so that you are looking away from people, may be look
      at a blocked view like a wall or a distant view like a window.

    message: Try active noise cancelling headphones, they are somehow expensive, but
      they are worth it in your case.

      every hour, and yes, I've tried Quraan and audio books :(

      Invest in a good noise canceling headset
      It is worth it
      The Bose QC23 is a very nice one
