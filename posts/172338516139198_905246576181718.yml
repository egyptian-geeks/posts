      I am not sure if it is related or not, but Chrome is know to increase the "tick rate" in the operating system to get more snappier feeling, which has the side effect of heat and battery drain because the CPU doesn't get enough idle time, there was a blog post from one of the Chrome Engineer to justify this

      I had this problem until I figured it all out. I use chrome on Ubuntu as well. and mine reached to over 3gb of ram and 99% of the processor.  one of these reasons might be the cause of your problem:
      - Check your apps and extensions using Chrome task manager (shift+esc). May be one or more of them causig the memory leak.
      - Reset all of the flags to their defaults and only enable them when needed. I found that some flags like experimental web features increases ram used noticeably.
      - lastly, and I figured this out yesterday that it was a sync issue. By logging into your Google account I found that my bookmarks were duplicated many times till they reached 200k. This was the biggest reason for the issue. I exported them to a file, cleared all of synced data from the google account, and looking forward to filter the exported bookmarks with a script or something.
      With all of these I reached around 600-700mb of ram but i'm ok with that because I do rely on many chrome apps and extensions.
