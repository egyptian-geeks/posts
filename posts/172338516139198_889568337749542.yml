      I did taste it ... back in 2007/2008 using Ubuntu 7.10 :D
      It was cool and fancy, but when it got to real usage (not just stuff in a browser) I was more comfortable in Windows, I'm not a terminal person.
      I also like how MS now unified the dev tools for all their platforms, so this "IoT version" of Windows 10 should be programmable using the same WinRT APIs I use for desktop/tablet Win8.1 and WP8.1, and I'm already heavily invested in C# (and XAML), so this would be the easier way for me. Even if I use Ubuntu on it, Mono (or .Net Core) will be the first thing I apt-get :D
      (edit: and I know that Python is very powerful too and (almost?) as readable as C#, but it would take some time for me to get used to it)

      If by native you mean unmanaged (C++) then no, but I do tons of stuff in C# (desktop and web). And on the Win8/WP8 side of things, I have very few complete stuff that are on the store, probably the fanciest is "Mawaweel" on Win8.1 and WP8 which is music player that plays stuff from mawaly.com (I don't like arabic music, I just got the chance to do this because a friend made an unofficial api for that website :D)

      And about stable environments, it seemed to me that every now and then there would be a not-so-stable Ubuntu release, and to me memory handling isn't a big issue (I just upgraded my laptop from 4GB to 8GB), the only problem I have right now is that Windows 8/8.1 seem to lock on hard drive access more than Win7 as if they assumed most people have SSDs now (or maybe my Hard Drive just got old), apart from that I comfortably run multiple instances of VS and debug stuff on my Phone and on IIS Express :)

      I recently delved a bit into the world of scripting, I learned Powershell which I found interesting and I wrote some PS scripts to help me manage an Azure VM (without having to Remote Desktop, but I still do anyways :D), but I also tried ScriptCS which uses Roslyn to make C# act like a scripting language which I found easier and more natural to me than Powershell :D

      and about WinForms, I haven't done anything significant with WinForms (apart from an app to backup your tweets to sql compact, to make is searchable w keda :D) because I quickly switched to WPF as it felt more powerful.

      and about desktop environments, my geekness doesn't really show up in that area :D I'm not a multi-monitor freak (although I'm trying make use of Win10's multiple desktop feature) and don't use crazy file explorers, and I'm quite used to keyboard navigation on Windows with my Win+E and Win+S and Win+W w keda :D
