      GPA 3.85/4 did not help me getting a single call for interview as a fresh graduate.
      ITI is OVER rated.

      GPA is only needed if you wanna continue doing masters/PhD otherwise it's useless and good is the same as excellent
      Technology wise, it really depends on what you wanna do and where you wanna work. If your target is to work in a small company in egypt, then yes, those are very technology-centric and they care so much about which technology you know and they always tend to respect newer technologies (for example, once Ruby became the trend, you won't see them asking for asp.net anymore)
      If your target is an international firm, they don't give a damn about which technology you know because they build technologies. They only want you to be very good and the main principals of computer science and be smart and a team player. That's it
