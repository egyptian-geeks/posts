      (not in AlMakinah but in other occasions and places) and that's my feedback.

      I recommend it 110% for all whom I know asln, not because I was a mentor, but actually the criculum and the lecturers are in-comparable to any other program in the middle east, and price-wise it's incomparable to anyother program worldwide with this quality.
      I understand that the price is a bit high for some people, and it was for sure high for almost all the students in the first bootcamp. But first of all, there are lots of scholarships that were granted last bootcamp, but other than the scholarship, it's simply less than 1500 usd for 600+ hours in 3 months with all those people (the best in market) working fully-dedicated to get you shaped up for your first full-time software engineer job. That's for the value of what you pay.
      For the return, you simple get back this amount in less than 6 month's salary from your first job landed after graduation. And the students' testimonies should be more than enough.

    message: And one last thought, one semester in the GUC costs now around 50k. I'm
      a graduate from there and one semester there won't make you market ready like
      the bootcamp. So 25k (which is half the GUC fees) is a bargain considering that
      you should be able to earn that amount in less than 6 months.

    message: "Hi Abdelrhman \n\nI am a graduate of AlMakinah Boot-camp and this wasn't
      my first experience with them\n\nI came from a medical background and decided
      to learn programming, I tried some online courses and I faced many problems
      like being lost between the huge amount of online \"free\" content without any
      guidance or experience to choose a specific track and follow it, I didn't have
      a mentor or any a network and I struggled a lot and this affected my persistence
      back then.\n\nI knew about their very first short program Gear-Up, and I joined
      it.\nIt was only 12 classes over weekends.\n\nAfter we finished this program
      they have been always in touch with us following our updates and encouraging
      us to learn more and do more effort.\n\nAlthough it was only an introduction
      course (not the boot camp) to the front end, it helped me and other friends
      to get jobs as junior front-end developers with help from Almakinah.\n\nAlthough
      I was working, but when they announced the boot camp I decided to quit and join
      them without any hesitation because I knew that it is totally worth it.\n\nTo
      be honest I was concerned about the cost like most of applicants, but they offered
      many options like CIB installments and scholarships to eliminate this concern
      as much as possible\n\nAnd over the 3 months about 600 hours or more, we had
      the best learning experience that we have never expected to find in Egypt.\n\nMany
      of us had scholarships (full and partial), from the first day we started learning
      the best practices for everything that many people take it for granted or practice
      in a wrong way.\n\nWe received a high quality content which was well prepared
      to meet the global standards.\n\nThe great and deep experience of our instructors
      took the learning experience to whole new level because it wasn't only about
      the information but also their teaching skills, patience and continuous support.\n\nThey
      don't only teach the concepts of UX there, but they apply every tip of it to
      make sure that every single person gets the best experience that he could have
      over the 3 months.\n\nWe were always challenged and it wasn't easy because once
      you learn something new and feel comfortable with it, you will be pushed to
      another challenge.\n\nIt's tough and not easy and you should expect long days
      with less sleeping hours to finish tasks of the day and you will be welcomed
      at the morning by the daily morning challenge and exercises after every new
      topic to make sure that you absorbed it. But believe me that you will be always
      happy and enjoying even if you feel exhausted because this always will be teasing
      your mind to think and work in a different way.\n\nYou will work alone and within
      teams on exercises and projects over the 3 months, You will meet people from
      a wide range of backgrounds and different type of personalities. You will be
      living with them like a family not just friends maybe because you will see them
      more than your family.\n\nIt's not only about the content or the instructors,
      but during this trip you learn how to learn, you will learn technologies that
      are demanded in the market and will learn the basics that you will need to learn
      any other new technologies.\n\nAnd on graduation you will have online portfolio
      with the projects that you have worked on during the boot camp. \n\nAlso it
      will not always be serious, but you will have some fun like a movie night or
      playing some crazy and fun games or a trip to a far city to recharge your energy
      before the final project\n\nThere will be also after hour talks presented by
      some successful people in the tech market inside or outside Egypt and maybe
      you will present your own talk about an interesting topic from your choice\n\nYou
      will also receive training on other skills like time management, working under
      pressure, how to to work with different types of personalities at the work environment
      and much more\n\nThe support that you will receive from Almakinah will continue
      after the boot camp until you land a job and even after it through advice and
      mentorship.\n\nMany of our batch of the boot camp landed jobs in interesting
      places and others are in the middle of hiring process with some hiring partners
      of Alamkinah or other companies.\n\nIn a short, this boot camp deserves every
      pound of its cost.\n\nI hope that my short comment \U0001F602 gives you a good
      answer to your question, and don't hesitate to ask about anything in your mind
      \U0001F600\U0001F609"

    message: "Hi Abdelrhman\n\nThis is gonna be a very long post. If you’re not interested
      in a very detailed answer, my quick answer is yes, this bootcamp is completely
      worth the money and more. It does what it promises and I did land a job through
      Almakinah right after I graduated from the boot camp. If you’re interested in
      more details, grab yourself a drink because this is gonna be LONG..\n\nI was
      lucky to join the first student batch of AlMakinah's three months Fireup Bootcamp
      in March 2017. I studied Physics in college and worked as a graphic designer
      for 11 years so I don’t really have computer science anywhere in my background.
      \ \n\nWhen I first joined the bootcamp, I already had a previous year of some
      random, unguided process of self learning trying to figure out “this cool coding
      thing”. It wasn’t long before I found myself completely interested in a career
      shift, and also completely lost with the humongous amount of resources I found
      online. I didn’t know which language to learn, what the market was like, and
      definitely wasted a good chunk of time and money on some vague resources that
      just scratch the surface of things that aren’t necessarily market trendy right
      now. \n\nSoon enough, I figured that if I really wanted to pursue a career in
      this field, I might have to join a coding bootcamp. I already knew about coding
      bootcamps and the closest I could get to them was online or through a plane
      ticket and thousands of dollars. Like a sane Egyptian in her twenties who doesn’t
      happen to have thousands of dollars, I went for a free online coding bootcamp.
      It was a nice experience, but again, the self learning style and the lack of
      one on one mentorship threw me completely off track and I wasn’t sure what I
      was doing. I knew I was learning something, but whenever I tried to apply what
      I learned, I still can’t see myself as someone with a solid, marketable set
      of skills. \n\nI found out about AlMakinah’s bootcamp completely randomly through
      a friend of mine, and the first thought that crossed my mind was “Well, this
      is definitely NOT cheap! They better know what they’re doing with all that money..”
      \ It was a take it or leave it situation for me, though, either break the piggy
      bank, stop life and business for three months, take a deep breath and a good
      leap of faith with those people or just keep moving at the deadly pace of unguided
      self learning, not sure if I’m ever getting where I should be as a developer.
      I wasn’t sure whether this was going to be a smarter step towards that career
      shift I wanted to do, or the most idiotic thing I have ever done in my professional
      life. Anyways, the only way to find out how smart/wasteful it would be was to
      go for it, so I went for it and hoped for the best.. \n\nThe first day I got
      there I realized that I’m gonna have to push my limits like I’ve never done
      before. I had a pretty solid idea of some basics through online resources (or
      so I thought), and on my very first week there, I already started to feel challenged
      and freaked out at the amount of information they called “basics”. I realized
      that I was so damn lucky to end up finding out about this program and actually
      getting accepted there.  One week in, it was still the pre-course phase, where
      only a selected group of people would be able to continue with the actual bootcamp
      based on how they score on some assessments. This is the point where I felt
      like I would kill to stay in this program. Hell, I would pay double to stay
      on this program already! \n\nEvery single day, Almakinah program added an essential
      fragment of valuable info to us students. They essentially cut it short and
      put an end to my clueless self learning phase.  This bootcamp was definitely
      not introductory and not for someone who’s just in their toe dipping phase about
      coding. These people will push the toe dipper right into the water and teach
      them how to perfect their freestyle leg kick over three months\n\nBack to our
      long story, another lucky moment for me was through my first month on the program.
      I was getting ready to pay the first installment ( Don’t want to sound like
      a lame bubbly customer on a telecommercial but I gotta say that I was definitely
      happy to pay double the money at that point if I could ),  and I just found
      out that I got a full scholarship from Elves , which is also where I started
      working straight after graduating the program along with 4 other amazing colleagues
      of mine. Working for Elves made me understand why joining AlMakinah was the
      smartest decision I’ve ever made in my life. I don’t think I would’ve made it
      anywhere serious following my own random learning patterns. The industry is
      too fast paced for learning without direction and trying to keep up with the
      market. I don’t even think I would’ve still liked coding if I didn’t join the
      bootcamp. Coding gets very frustrating at times, and keeping the motivation
      and direction on your own can be very difficult. I had the best learning and
      personal growth experience with AlMakinah, and to be with so many people with
      diverse backgrounds and ages sharing a common passion and going through common
      challenging, yet pleasurable daily struggles everyday to get better at coding
      was a huge motivation to keep me going whenever I questioned my ability to handle
      this hardcore learning experience.\n\nFinally, we’re all middle-class students
      and you don’t pay 25k everyday for a course, but some people actually pay double
      that for a semester that probably won’t get them halfway through what the market
      really needs. The selling point of AlMakinah is not putting together some random
      material out there for you like other courses do at 2 and 3K that aren’t even
      fair to pay in my opinion.  Material is everywhere, paid and unpaid. And to
      keep it real,  you can get endless material for free with good research skills
      and download speed. This program is about investing your time and money into
      something that has quality, handcrafted and personalized material that is relevant,
      straight to the point and dense enough to kick start a career, a one on one
      mentorship tailored for someone who is hungry for valuable information, a clear,
      realistic learning path that actually gets you somewhere professionally, and
      simply developing a set of mental skills that allow for further, continuous
      learning so you don’t just stop where the boot camp got you. My key advice here
      as someone who is happily riding this crazy coding roller coaster is that this
      particular industry is for people who are constantly willing to upgrade themselves
      and dive into new topics every single day. This could be something that you’re
      willing to do, but the ability and skills that allow you to continuously and
      quickly learn and stay up to date reside in a solid, well guided foundation.
      \n\nMy conclusions after the 3 months program:\n - Money wise, 25K is dirt cheap
      value for the overall output this boot camp left \n   me with.\n - Time wise,
      my three months away from business were definitely worth it, and I \n    still
      can’t wrap my head around how they managed to teach us all the stuff we \n    learned
      in just 3 months. \n - Do you get a decent job afterwards if you’re serious?
      I know I did. \n - How much is an Iphone? 22K \n - Would I pay this much for
      an iphone? Aw Hell Naw!\n - Why am I spending a friday morning writing this
      for hours instead of chilling? \n    Because the mentors spent 3 months changing
      my life, and they would \n    happily do it again and again for others. \n\nThat’s
      it. Sorry for the long post. Hope you find it informative to an extent :D"

      Hi abdelrahman,

      Al-makinah boot-camp was the best learning experience I had in my life.

      I'm a civil engineering student and I wanted to leran code, I started learning alone online but I wanted to be  supervised by some one who can tell me what is right and what is worng ,then I heared about Al-Makinah and of course I couldn't afford the fees but they had scholarships which encouraged me to apply and go through the process and Al-hamdullah I got fully funded scholarship.

      The curriculum will make you ready to join the market as junior developer , tou will learn everything from programming concepts data-structures databases ..etc ,
      And will have both front-end  and back-end knowledge and they will make able to work with any stack as you will be able to learn any new technology on your own.

      For example we learned rails but now I work at MUMM using symfony and php.

      What also makes Al-Makinah differnet is the mentor ,you will have close supervision and they will know what you are good at and what needs to be worked on and this not something you will find anywhere else.

      And beside the technical knowledge will gain at the boot-camp they will introduce you to the tech community and you will have alot of great connections form startup founders to industry experts.

      And one last thing ,Al-Makinah have a goal is to make you ready for the market and they will do every thing to achieve thier goal even after you finish the boot-camp.

      Hello Abdelrhman Yousry, I am one of Almakinah's fireup graduates. I am a Libyan citizen, happily married and living in Tunisia for almost 3 years now. And this is a list of things I had to sacrifice in order to attend the bootcamp:
      - Quit my job (again, I am married)
      - My parents thought I was crazy
      - Applied twice for the Egyptian visa
      - Travelled 1,265 Km by land ( Benghazi -> Cairo ), and was hell.
      - and much much more.

      now, after graduating from Almakinah, and spending literally the best 3 months of my life at that place. Do I regretted it? NO! not a tiny little bit. Would I do it again? YES! a thousand times more.

      P.s: here is a link to my youtube vlog documenting my days at Almakinah https://goo.gl/W6KgH1                                                                                               and this is blog post I wrote that might give you a flavour of what a bootcamp is like : https://blog.almakinah.com/4-things-to-consider-before-you-head-out-to-a-coding-bootcamp-e744263d6fe6
