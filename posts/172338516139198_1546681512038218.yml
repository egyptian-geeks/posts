  During my software developing journey, I have always been thinking of software client side-ly... What about broadening my knowledge horizon?

  What do u recommend to start another journey thinking and developing server side-ly?

  I prefer #MEAN but don't know where's the best guide/course/instructor to follow?

      On edx.org there is a good course called "mean stack ..." I think this is where you should start. Its good and fast paced.

      Good luck
