  What kind of knowledge needed or what should I know to build a monitoring system?
  This system should do the following:
  1. Real time employee' computer monitoring.
  2. Manager computer must have an access to employees' computers.
  3. Block specific web sites (ex. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, online shopping web, and other messenger programs for chat conversation).
  4. Multiple employees' screens need to be on manager's screen.
  5. Need to provide a screenshot automatically as every second, or minute for a manager, when he/she wants to look. All the screenshots needs to save to the main server with time stamp.
  6. Tracking service that a manager can check how much employees have spent their time for.
  7. Tracking service what employees get download, upload, or moving files to portable device (USB, Portable hard disk).
  8. Employees must not have access, or delete the program by themselves (Key code).
  9. Website visited.
  10. Block games.
  11. Block apps.
  12. Block music players.

  I got these specs from a project posted in freelance.com, and I am very curious to learn how to build such thing.

  So please anyone has the knowledge on how can I start in this direction, I will be very happy.

  You can provide me with the name of subjects to study and why to study it.

  Thanks,
