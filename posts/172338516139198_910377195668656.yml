  Hey guys,
  I'm working on a C based GUI. I don't know whether to use GTK+ or the native Windows API.
  Which one is easier and more efficient (memory, run time, etc..) ?

      Simpy if you want it to work on Macosx and Linux and widnows use gtk or wxwidgets
      if you don't care about osx and linux then go windows api

      Why are you asking for efficiency? The bottleneck will never be drawing the GUI, it's always the user.
      That said in the long run, learning C++ with Qt would be the best if you want to do GUIs that are easily interacting with C.
      If you plan on continuing Windows GUI development, you should know your way around the WinAPI too, so you might as well start learning it in your current project.
      GTK+ Is also good but looks too ugly (unnative) for my taste.

      Disclaimer: I don't do UIs in C.

    message: Which platform do you want to cover? BTW, Language has nothing to do
      with the GUI API. If you have access to the framebuffe of the GPU or software
      renderer using the CPU, you can write your own GUI. Use a library that is cross-platform
      like Qt.
