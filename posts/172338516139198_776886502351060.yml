    message: The one thing I like most about the article is how its perspective doesn't
      suggest what you say in your commentary. But, nevermind anyway.

    message: from the day one, i criticized the forced migration of desktop windows
      to the touch-friendly metro. apple didn't unify its ecosystem entirely by the
      way. i hate ms design team and their strategy

    message: I have to agree with Ahmed Adel... Metro is designed as a mobile touchscreen
      UI... MS are retarded for imposing that UX on thier desktop users... first thing
      i did on Win8.1 was install a startmenu and practically remove metro out of
      the way.

      nevermind.
