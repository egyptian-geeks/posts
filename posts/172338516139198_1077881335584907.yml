message: "For those who were asking about the StackOverflow IP ban, It's not intended
  and they are aware of the issue : https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/status/697612948638932993
  \nThe reason one of the SysAdmins mentioned is: \"This was someone scraping SO questions
  that kept hopping around to different IPs in the CIDR block\" \nOn a side note,
  Nick Craver is someone to follow on Twitter :D"
