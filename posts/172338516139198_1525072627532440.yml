  willing to pay for a VPN service that doesn''t limit speed or bandwidth? (If you
  don''t want to setup your own, of course). Thanks!'

      I already pay 5$ a month but VPN for me is not about speed or bandwidth at all
      it all comes to privacy
      and if you want to make sure that your company will work make sure you get a good review on thatoneprivacysite.net

    message: I pay 35$ a year with private tunnel (provided by OpenVPN), and I consider
      the price very reasonable. The speed is good most of the time.

    message: It cannot get north $7 a month, otherwise a make-your-own VPN server
      is as costly, and gives me better privacy and control.

    message: I currently pay $10 a year for a shitty server, with 1TB bandwidth, to
      house my openvpn setup. I would pay up to $30 year if the vpn has enough features
      so that my iphone and android devices would be easier to setup.
