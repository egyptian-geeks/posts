      Last time Mohamed Meligy said no one even liked Mohammad Tayseer's comment so
      we joked about it and this is a reference to that joke. What is even more funny,
      is that every time someone here tells a joke or becomes sarcastic, people started
      using <sarcastic> <sarcastic/> tags so other geeks can understand that they
      are bieng sarcastic, while it seems with normal people, they just get it cause
      it is funny :)

    message: Now not all humor is compatible like an API , agreed. Sheldon Cooper
      didn't understand humor or sarcasm, but he didn't go around suspecting people
      either:) The funny thing in this "social experiment" is the fact that although
      we are geeks, we just have some extra passion to learn, we are neither smarter
      nor more intelligent beings over all. IN fact, we can be dumber than other people,
      and that is part of the humor of "the big bang theory". Also, intelligence comes
      at many levels and people just think it is basic/advanced Algorithms :). Also,
      geeks don't just neccesarily learn about computers, there are Yoga geeks, meditation
      geeks, Agri geeks, Medical geeks, Psycho geeks and many more. I also hang out
      with Art geeks, and music geeks. Just the realization that cause you are better
      at Physics, does not make you more intelligent, you just have a small gift,
      and will only attain a very small amount of real knowledge if at all in your
      life. Also, many people lack understanding that Wisdom is way more important
      that knowledge. Anyways, forgot where I was actually going with this :)

    message: <non-emotional>I am not upset at anything specific here in this group,
      I am discussing the way of the world in general. i.e. I am making an observation.
      I personally have had an unnamed company persecute me for  "being a geek", although
      it was a software company. The funny thing is, they always considered being
      a geek was a bad thing and the word geek to be a negative word. So I am just
      trying to explain that it is not just a television stereotype, and that as geeks
      we need to first understand what the word really means. You know that people
      didn't like the tech club I created cause they didn't like the name "geeks corner"
      :) I do get emotional sometimes, but never really take things to heart that
      much, cause if I did I would probably be a hardcore drug addict with homocidal
      tendencies :)  I wonder what the maximum size of data in an XML tag is? Does
      anyone know? </non-emotional>

      It's actually "Sieg" not "Seig". Pronounced "zeeg" not stressing too much on the G, if German had a "Seig" it would have been pronounced "zaay-ig" and the word would sound too complex in a short sentence.

      Sieg Heil = "Zeeg-Haay-el"
      Seig Heil = "Zaay-ig Haay-el" would be a mouthful and German is already a mouthful.
