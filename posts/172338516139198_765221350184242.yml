  Sometimes i just wonder, why Adobe make such pathetic editor for PDF files that called Acrobat .. which (in my opinion) very poor in functionality and editing ??!
  So I will ask every body the best PDF solution that each one ever use ? and Pros/Cons of his choices

      I believe the word you intended was "pathetic".

      As for PDFs, I use Pages from iWorks '9 on a Mac for any fancy document editing, for plain text documents I only do markdown and there's a lot of OSS out there to convert from markdown to PDFs but I don't recall ever having the need to do so. Pandoc [1] has always looked promising though.

      For writing ebooks, I use GitBook [2]. You could also write ebooks in Pandoc

      You didn't mention that Acrobat takes a lot of processing power for nothing, literally.
      I tried an open source viewer called Sumatra PDF, it's very lightweight application and it loads almost instantly, renders pages extremely quickly,but as it's a free application expect some pitfalls and crashes.
      Another option will be Foxit or PDF-Xchange they are both the same and each one coasts around $30 for the pro version, but personally i prefer PDF-Xchange, i used the free basic version with basic functionality that outpaces the basic functionality of Acrobat.
      It loads fairly quick, and you can perform simple page annotations with drawings and text.
