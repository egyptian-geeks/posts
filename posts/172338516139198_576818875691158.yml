      Very good video I'm really enjoyed :), we can also combine the two classes in one like this please try it and tell me your comment.

        display: inline-block;
        width:0px;
        height:0px;
        margin :0px;
        padding: 0px;
        background : transparent;
        border : transparent 50px solid;
        border-left : 50px solid red;
        border-right-width : 0px;

      The idea is that you can have different classes for top, bottom, right and left arrows, that all share the same parts that make an arrow at all.

      This is what I did in the second example, starting at 7:56

      If I'm building a reusable CSS style for arrows, I'll use a base class with multiple classes for multiple directions. If it's a one-time thing, I'll use one class.

      Note that the dropdown example uses one class only. The example starts at 9:43

      If you mean support older IE versions than 8, then maybe. There is a library https://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/ which has a demo for just that here http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/test/after.html
      In reality, if you add this library late in the development and you have very complex design, it can have bad side effects.

    message: Frankly, if you worry about IE7 support, then just use actual SPAN elements
      or so. I wouldn't use :before and :after. Your selector could then change to
      something like ".drop-down > .arrow". The project I worked on recently was for
      a bank. We did worry about IE7 support, IE7.js fiddled with other complex things
      we built, so, we just added empty elements.

      I meant I have an empty element at the end of the drop-down (for all browsers), and target it with CSS instead of targeting :after. Like:
