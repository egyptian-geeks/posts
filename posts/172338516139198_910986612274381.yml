  عادت ظاهرة السؤال بكثرة هذة الأيام ... ليست المشكلة في مستوى الأسئلة فنحن نرحب بالمساعدة للكل المبتدئين قبل المحترفين ... المشكلة ان البعض اعتاد الاستسهال ... فبدلاً من أن يذهب الفرد الى Google ويبحث عن حل للمشكلة التي تواجهه ويقرأ ويجرب يأتي الى هنا ويسأل السؤال بدون حتى أن يتعب نفسه في توفير المعلومات الكافية حول المشكلة ... إسمحوا لي أن أسرد قصة حدثت لي متذ سنتان تقريباً ...
  كنت أبحث في أمر  دقيق جداً لإعدادات خادم Apache ليعمل على Windows ... قرأت في الـ Documentation الخاصة بـ Apache وموقع آخر خاص بـ Apache لـ Windows يدعى (ِApache Lounge) وبحثت في StackOverflow لم أجد اجابة فقمت بطرح السؤال على Stackoverflow وجائت أربعة اجابات لم تكن تحديداً ما أبحث عنه ...
  أثناء البحث لفت انتباهي اجابات تنم عن معرفة قوية جداً لمصري على Stackoverflow ... طالعت اجاباته فوجدت انه متخصص في اعدادات الخودام فبحثت عنه ووجدته على Github و Twitter ووصلت إلى بريده الإليكتروني الشخصي. أرسلت إليه رسالة تعريفية أعرفه بنفسي وأطلب منه المساعدة ... شرحت له في الرسالة كافة الروابط التي عثرت عليها والحلول التي جربتها ولم تساعدني في حل مشكلتي والسؤال الذي سألته على Stackoverflow و Serverfault. ذيلت الرسالة بأنها ليست عادتي أن أسأل أحد على بريده الشخصي وانني متفهم تماماً اذا اختار عدم الرد واننا احترم ذلك ... جائني الرد بعد نصف ساعة وسأقتبس كلماته:
  " I usually don't give private consultation for free, but I would probably hate myself if I didn't offer help after you have put some obvious effort in research and in understanding and writing about your problem"
  وقام هذا الشخص العزيز بالرد على استفساري وساعدني في حل المشكلة. أصبحنا بعدها أصدقاء وتطورت العلاقة بيننا وعملنا سوياً.
  ما أريد ان أقوله للزملاء الجدد أنه طالما لم تقم بشرح المشكلة التي تواجهها بشكل كامل وأظهرت المجهود الذي بذلته لمحاولة الوصول الى حل لن يهتم أحد لمساعدتك لأنه ببساطة "احنا فينا اللي مكفينا" ... من أجل أن نصل الى نقاشات مثمرة يجب أن تظهر المجهود الذي تبذله.

    message: الفكرة ان الناس بتسأل الاسئلة وبيلاقى غضاضة فى انك تقترح عليك Google
      It من ايام قليلة بس كنت ادمن فى جروب Egy C# Developers وخرجت منه العدد الى عليه
      حوالى 15 الف معظم الناس اسئلتها بل تقريبا كل الناس اسئلتها من النوعية المفروض
      انها لو اتعمل لها post هنا تتحذف وش لكن من معاملتى على مدار سنه مع الناس دى
      هما مش بيملوا ابدا من انهم يحطوا بوستات وتتحذف وبعدين يكتب بوست انتوا حذفتوا
      البوست ليه وهيقصر عليك ويقولك دورت فى جوجل مش عارف ولو جبت له جوجل هيقولك مش
      فاهم اشرحلى بالعربى للأسف معظم الناس الى بتسأل بيكون هو محطوط فى case وعايز
      يخرج منها بحل Code عشان يخرج بيه من المشكلة لكن للأسف معظمهم او اغلبهم كأساس
      مفيش يعنى احد الأعضاء كان بيسأل ازاى يعرف variable من نوع string بس اسم ال variable
      عايز يحط فيه dot وطبعا الناس بدأت تقترح عليه بدل وتجود وتخترع الفكرة مش فى الناس
      دى لوحدها بيكون فيه حد دون المستوى خالص وحد تانى منتظر سؤاله بيكون دون المستوى
      بس اعلى شوية فبيكون فرصه ليه انه يحل له سؤاله ويظهر وكدا :) فالموضوع دا عشان
      يتحل ان الجروب يكون معلن تماما انه مش للمبتدئين

      كورس او بيتفرج على حد فى يوتيوب مش عايز هو يخرج من الجو دا اصلا فهو مقتنع تماما
      ان سؤاله عن حاجة شديدة البداهة انها من الأساسيات الى لابد يكون اتعلمها هو مش
      فاهم كدا مش قادر يفرق ان فيه حد ادنى عشان ابدأ اشتغل وللأسف مش عايز ومش قابل

      can be an advanced topic, and even the most basic syntax deserves a coser look.
      Actually, if people really love to code, declaring something as advanced or
      intermediate becomes pathetic, because every line of code is done with love

    message: I mentioned at the beginning of the post that it's not about the level
      of the question. Let's talk for instance about one of the active questions here
      "which php framework do you recommend" what if we changed the question to be
      more specific like "I am new to php and I don't have any other background about
      programming, which php framework that would be easy for me to pick?" or "I searched
      for php frameworks and found a comparison about laravel and codeigniter but
      I am not sure which one should I pick, what do you recommend?" Isn't that better?
      I understand a little about Php but I would give my little personal experience
      about how awesome I found to work with laravel templating and views. This is
      how you build a discussion and help people,

      Mohamed Samy: You are completely missing the point, the original problem discussed here is that many people don't exert any effort in trying to figure out the answer themselves first, which is an indication that they don't really want to learn and just want to get the thing done with minimal effort! (which is a bad trait in general)
      This is the main problem that not many people here disagree on, and I hope you don't disagree on that.

      Now the second problem which is much more controversial is whether to allow beginner questions in general (with visible effort from the asker or without), when people say they want to avoid beginner questions they aren't being elitists or egotistic (you always make it sound horrible like that :S), they just wish they could categorise things, basically have a group for beginner topics and a group for intermediate/advanced topics.
      I'm personally part of this Egy C# group and I used to help a lot of people when I had more free time because I'm a normal person who likes helping beginners and I'm good at explaining things, then again I would like to have some sort of channel/stream of more advanced stuff that I could check, that's why I'm a member of this group and spend most of my time lurking around and learning from people who know more than me in certain areas.

    message: Hassan Aly Selim I do believe it sounds horrible because it is. There
      are many groups out there on the internet and none of them have this strange
      categorization. One cold argue that as a PHD student of Mathematics, people
      here are not really advance, but that would just be plain wrong.  I believe
      people do need to search, but perhaps some need an extra hand to get started,
      not everone's brain is the same. Also, maybe what seems trivial to you might
      be advanced to others, and maybe what you see as advanced is trivial to some
      people.  In the end, someone who makes his living manipulating HTML markup with
      a scripting language might not sound like a geek at all to some Computer Scientist
      who goes to MIT, or Stanford. We can say level 100/200 topics go to a speciifc
      place, but we can't say that if someone here comes asking for help we act like
      a bunch of snobs. I remeber some people here when they started out, they were
      worthy of a lot of pity actually, but I helped them and possibly even provided
      opportunities for them. The idea is, even a trivial question by someone you
      deem a noob is your duty to answer if you can. Allah provides us with knowledge,
      so if you see yourself (directed to all) as a guru, then take on apprentices,
      do sessions and teach these people, help others learn. But just saying, I only
      want to see advance topics because I have outgrown this level 100 stuff, I just
      think it is immoral. I am sorry if this somehow comes accross angry, I am not
      angry or aggresive at all now, I am drinking coffee and explaining my concept
      :) There is a hadeeth that if you hide knowledge from someone, you get tied
      by a fire like a donkey. Anyway, this is the idea. Give and take, make rules,
      answer noob questions, make an faq, but don't delete or condescend them.

      they will probably go learn about Django. Sometimes, a small discussion with
      someone could give you a priceless piece of info that saves your career or even
      gets you a promotion. The stuff I was praised for most is funnly stuff I didn't
      put that much effort into. There were projects that I put my heart and sould

      of coderush, and just hearing about it from google is different to someone who
      tried it.

      You are putting words in my mouth here, I said that I am a member of Egy C# Developers and I do help beginners because I'm good at it, and I'm a believer that knowledge should be free (ever since I was a kid) just like you, and everybody should share their knowledge regardless of religious view.
      But I'm also an organized person and categorize my stuff (do you put all files in one folder?), I like to go somewhere to get jokes, another place to help people, another place to see tech news, and another for dev discussions and so on.
      Don't try to make us look like we hate beginers, WE DON'T!

      like this seem too snobby with noobs. Also, I don't know who "we" are, I am
      talking about a few attitudes I see here, they just seem wrong to me. That is
      how I see it, read it, and out of honesty and care for both the beginners and
      the "advanced", I think we should all have this beginner attitude all the way
      through our careers. The so called Guru attitude I am seeing is really snobbish,
      I think we can always have some FAQs and direct people to them, You don't have
      to find many posts here relevant. I used to be a MS fundamentalist, not I love
      open source, thinsg change, expert in one thing, noob in another, the good thing
      is to learn. Otherwise, if you think there should be a Gurus group, I guess
      it should be secret and invitation only from Guru to Guru after taking permission
      from the brotherhood of Gurus. The reality is, I have spoken with some Gurus
      with over 50 patents under their belt and asked them very basic questions, like
      the time I asked the Dynamics langauaged PM what a Dynamic language was, and
      you know what? He spent 30 mins explaining :)  I do put all files in one folder
      btw :) but in internet groups, I think we are all basically a motely crew of
      different platforms, disciplines and expertise.

      Because it goes beyond that. This attitude manifests itself in tons of posts with trivial content, whose posters want someone to do their job for them, which is -for the millionth time, mind you- is neither what this group is for, nor what serious people join it for.

      And by serious people I mean those interested in the subject of the group rather than throw away a silly question and disappear.

      well I'm sure most us don't have that ego you're talking about here, and are more than willing to help others.
      I might have seen some snobbish acts here, but it's definitely a minority and isn't related to certain people (we all have bad days an accidentally say things that sound bad online).
      I'm pretty sure that when most of us vote for limiting beginner questions we're doing it for the sake of organizing our lives.
      I personally rarely check my FB newsfeed, I just add a few people to a list so I get notifications when they post something and I check a bunch of categorized groups. And I like reddit because of how very categorized and specific each subreddit is (eg: there is one just for trying to make something with the least amount of code possible).

      There isn't really a definition for advanced, because everything is relative!
      That's why the admins try their best to take the general consensus when they're unsure about it (they don't just remove posts willy nilly), and that's why they depend on us reporting the posts, and that's why they considered moving the group over to Reddit many times before because on reddit everybody gets to vote on every post!

      I've lurked around a few IRC channels, they are either empty and boring, or full and chaotic.
      But I wouldn't mind us having an IRC channel on the side for random geeky discussions, we can make it an experiment :)

      Edit: now that I think of it, an advantage of IRC is that noise doesn't hurt, it's just a few lines that scroll by with no burden, and soon it will pop out of your logs. But social media posts last forever so the noise is permanent and bulky.
