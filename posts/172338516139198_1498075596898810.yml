  11 large empty boxes are placed on a table. An unknown number of the boxes is selected and, into each one, eight medium boxes are placed. An unknown number of the medium boxes is selected and, into each one, eight small boxes are placed.
  At the end of this process there are 102 empty boxes. How many boxes are there in total?
  Anyone can explain ,how to solve it ?

      All the 11 boxes are full of medium boxes, and 2 medium boxes have 16 small boxes in them. So, 88 medium boxes - 2 +16 small boxes that's a total of 102
      I was trying to figure out how to think about it, and I assumed some numbers and my assumptions hit the jackpot.

      Large boxes:
      11 = total number of large boxes
      x = number of filled large boxes
      11 - x = number of empty large boxes

      Medium boxes:
      8x = total number of medium boxes
      y = number of filled medium boxes
      8x - y = number of empty medium boxes

      Small boxes:
      8y = total number of small boxes
      All small boxes are empty.

      Therefore:
      Total number of empty boxes:
      = (11 - x) + (8x - y) + 8y
      = 11 + 7x + 7y

      102 = 11 + 7x + 7y ---> (1)
      102 - 11 = 7x + 7y
      91 = 7x + 7y (then divide by 7)
      13 = x + y ---> (2)

      Total number of boxes:
      = 11 + 8x + 8y ---> (3)

      From (1) and (3), total boxes = 102 + x + y
      By replacing (x+y) with 13 from (2), total boxes = 102 + 13 = 115
