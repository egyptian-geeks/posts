message: "Hi, I've been having some weird problem with Google services \n \nI have
  more than one Android device and all of them simultaneously stopped updating apps.\n\nI'm
  only able to update or download apps with 3G data,\n\nusing Tedata connection doesn't
  download any updates or new apps.\n\nI thought it could be my wifi.\nbut it is working
  well in all other aspects.\n\nI'm even using my phones in wireless for any other
  type of data, streaming and downloading.\n\nI tried using  \"normal Te data \"  DNS,\ntried
  Comodo DNS\ngoogle DNS, all same results, \n\ncleared cache, restarted the devices,
  forced stop and running google store again with no results.\n\nany idea how to fix?\nI
  have already searched google for known solutions but none are working,\n\nthe only
  remaining solution is to factory reset the devices. but that's my last resort, and
  I'm not even sure it's a device problem now.\n\nThanks for help :)"
