    message: they don't have the right to ask you not to freelance or tell you what
      to do in your free time but they pay you to do the job you've been hired for
      and if moonlighting is going to affect your performance to do that job (i.e
      feeling sleepy at work because you've been freelancing all night) then they
      have every right to ask you to get more sleep at home so you can come to work
      awake :D

    message: Reread your contract carefully. In some contracts it is stated that all
      your intellectual creations are considered a property of the company. I don't
      think that's right but i have read such clause on multiple contracts.

      Yes they do have the right if they clearly stated that in the contract or beforehand, before joining the company. The reasons are so many but here are some
      1- you free lance then you will never be as focused and concentrated in your full time job as if you had some rest or spent your time doing something else
      2- copyrights. If you free lance you might end up at some poiny in time using the code you wrote earlier in another task which is absolutely forbidden. Anything you right or create in a company is owned 100% by thay company.
      3- conflict of interest. If you run into a free lance task that is similar or competing with the line of business of your full time job, ethically you shouldn't take that job
      4- delivery. If you are late in delivering something in your full time job or you have a release or something that requires you to stay late, you must dedicate yourself to the full time job. If you do not show up to finish the free lance work then that's why they put this restriction

      In the end the most important one is point 1, you will never be as focused and no matter what you do there will be a degradation in performance. Not because your time management skills are bad, but because your brain physicalls needs to rest.

      I'm not saying don't do it coz we all do it but I'm only answering your question.

      In your time or on the job??
      If it's not on the job, they have no right to even bring it up. Even if it's stated in the contract, what are the legal grounds to back it up?

    message: Yes, by labor law, even if it is not stated in your contract. You can
      either do it without telling that you do, or by the approval from your employer(
      friendly way).

      If it’s stated in your contract, they have the full right. Contrary to usual belief in Egypt, big companies like MicroSoft, Amazon, Facebook, google, etc, will have a clause in the contract for “moonlighting” that will give them all legal power to take away the rights of whatever you built or even fire you (unless you protect your ass by either having an explicit permission to engage in that or make something that can go around that clause)
      But usually yes, companies do that worldwide
