  This is called "innovation challenge", with a reward of $25,000. If you're not familiar with Innocentive, it is basically a platform that connects companies seeking innovative solutions to certain problems/challenges they face, with solvers who can provide such solutions. Most of the challenges  are very industry-specific, but this one is pretty doable with some of the skills and expertise available here. Read the details and if you're interested PM me with your expertise and let's form a team and win :) btw I happened to win a couple of such challenges before so that's why I say it's doable :)

  - description: As part of a clinical trial, patients are sometimes asked to record
      information between office visits. The patient’s assessment of a finding may
      not match the clinical diagnosis. It would be helpful for subjects to be able
      to document each event with an image that can be shared with their physician....
