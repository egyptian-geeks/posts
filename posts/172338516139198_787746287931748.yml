      does it gives you before it run out?

    message: Well it depends how much watts/vA you'll connect to it. A 1000vA (if
      not lower) will suffice for most desktops. this is the 1500va version. I should
      be getting about 20-40 mins of operation after it cuts, depending on load. What
      i noticed so far is that my electricity suffers constant voltage drops almost
      every 30 mins.

      for 3.4k. but you can get 1500va for as low as ~1.8k with lesser features

      Volt Ampere? That basically means Watt :)
      hmm... which doesn't make much sense, I would expect the capacity of something like that to be measured in Coulombs (or Ampere-Hour) or maybe Joules (or Watt-Hour)

      the time it can work offline varies a lot from model to model?

    message: Nope its not the same...  There is an efficiency variable  missing...  Industry
      standard is 70% so to find the wattage it supports.  For example  1000va equals
      to 1000x0.7= 700watts  and so forth.  Va is not equal watt in this case

      In this case I will need 1500, but with lesser features :P
      Thanks man :D You motivated me to take this step :D

      shit and see if its even possible
