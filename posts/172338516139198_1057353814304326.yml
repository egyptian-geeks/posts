message: "Reactjs and angular2 are not comparable. You may use a mix of reactjs and
  angular2. Angular2 is a framework for building SPAs. Reactjs is a library for building
  web components. So you won't find routers Api request helpers in reactjs but you'll
  find a lot of helpers coming out of the box with angular\n\n"

      I still think that they're comparable if you consider react-router (especially that react-router is maintained by Facebook as well)
      On the long run React's community (if not Facebook itself) will build the needed toolset for React to do what Angular does

      But my only issue with React now is that it changes A LOT and breaks a lot as well

      So if you tried to follow a tutorial today that was released a month ago most probably it won't work

      Also the ecosystem for React now and the tooling is very shattered, so hopefully they will sort all of that out
