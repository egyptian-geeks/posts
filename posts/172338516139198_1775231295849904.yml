      Also, the use of a scrapper to circumvent security and/or perform actions such as ticket purchases or form submission in such a way that can be considered hacking or brute Force attacks can be considered ... Hacking or a brute Force attack!
      So avoid doing anything like that.
      But as far as scrapping data from a webpage like currency exchange or anything in that vein should not be illegal.

      I think it depends on the Terms of Use, if they know their stuff, they'll probably have statements limiting you to only using their data in specific ways (through their web interface), so using their data in other ways like scraping would be illegal.
      This is how Google can take down YouTube Download apps and websites if they wanted to, because it breaks their Terms of Use.
