      Scratch is a very good option. It was created by MIT and it was designed so kids can learn it with ease.
      from the Pluralsight courses for kids, I recommend you to start by watching this one: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/teaching-kids-programming

      Let him start by problem solving, c++ and IOI competition. I would prefer this than learning web dev or so.
      Find Egyptian Olympiad in Informatics's fb page and let them join their events.

      I agree with Mohamed Nasif that kids learn faster if it's about building a game. Inspired to build a game like Red Alert, I picked up a 3d modeling course before realizing that I need to learn coding first to build a game, and that red alert 2 was 2d in the first place :D.

      As for kids learning PHP, I actually saw lynda.com offering a course on that topic! http://www.lynda.com/PHP-tutorials/Teach-Kids-Programming-PHP/142020-2.html

      As much as I would love to see my little 16 year old sister learn PHP, I can't even get her excited about the idea at all, and would love to see how I could. On the other hand, something like scratch might seem more interesting...

      In my own opinion getting someone excited about programming is very difficult at the first place if he/she doesn't have any interest at all already. I am considering the step just after getting his interest. I have meet a 16yr old boy who was participating in a regional Google+ hackathon and using PHP and I had the honor to discuss with him and his father how he ended up there! One major idea, that the father didn't even 'get him excited about the idea', rather the boy himself had enough initial interest to mimic websites and to build his own website. On the other hand, the young father was just trying so hard to provide him all available resources and exposing him to different opportunities - and that hackathon was one of them. Another model I witnessed is allowing kids to use robots to visualize their programs. In that model, kids got more excited when they saw the robot following the simple logic they programmed.
      I am not against Scratch itself, but I saw many boys in that age who weren't really interested in the results they get using it. Yet it will be nice to start with and observe the reactions, and if you feel your brother started to lose interest then introduce the next step to him.
      Another more interesting app in my opinion in that case would be MIT App Inventor http://appinventor.mit.edu/. The main difference, is that at least you can see the results on a mobile phone, which would be more interesting.

      lots of technical videos and english and read a lot of books. Always have a
      dictionary at hand, try to learn 10 new words every day with their meaning and

      I only have English on my keyboard and I need to use something like Yamli.com
      to write in Arabic, On Arabic keyboards my typing is slow.  It is not a matter
      of which is better, Also note, I knwo some people who joined Microsoft because
      they knew french and they weren't even that technical, knowing French or Spanish
      could give you a better chance of joining MS than being a tech Guru, even if
      you are just average BTW. I know this specially applys to support positions.
