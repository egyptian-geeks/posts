    message: "I tried many solutions over years, read hundreds of suggestions and
      \ntricks ... and I think I found the best way to do it , and I am using that
      for 3 years now. you can jump to my perfect solution or read my journey in finding
      that perfect solution: \n\n\n- I started with paper  : I like holding a book
      , going back and forth, it has a good feeling , you can write using pencils
      directly and taking notes .. BUT you can NOT really get every book in paper.
      you can't search , you can't do alot of things. so I had to find an easier way.
      \n\n- I tried reading on PC screen or laptop  , this will cause you a real eyestrain.
      also you will have to minimize your book , go back and forth between the book
      and the IDE . and once you start googling about how to handle eyestrain , you
      will hit \"eink - electronic ink\"  and many recommendation that a an eink device
      ( like kindle ) has the magical solution for all your reading problems. \n\n-
      I bought a Kindle , after using it for just 3 days, I realized that , it is
      definitely not for technical books. kindle is for novels and anything none technical.
      also you cant really display PDF or doing zooms. it sucks in PDF .and most of
      technical books are PDF format. ( all eink devices are the same including 'Nook'
      ) \n\n- So I bought a tablet :D , I searched for the cheapest 9.7\" ( the recommended
      size of tablet for reading technical books , this is the size of a standard
      IPAD , so I bought 'Inar') . reading on tablet is fine but I found that just
      reading doesn't make you satisfied  , you need to keep your hands busy, like
      taking notes in pencil ( what you were able to do while reading books in papers
      )  , also you need to translate some words  , so you go back and forth between
      dictionary installed on tablet. ( btw now we have google translate popup on
      android that can translate any word you can copy to clipboard , so you don't
      have to go back and forth between your page and translator , but still not a
      full solution for me ) , at the end reading on normal tablet is better than
      paper and kindle. but not the perfect or near to perfect. \n\n------------------------------\nMy
      Perfect Solution : \n------------------------------\n- Then I dumped all that
      , I got two 27\" FHD screens and a disk . you read on one screen ( After setting
      display mode for the screen you read on to text mode . lower back-light to avoid
      eye strain , or you can turn night mode in your pdf reader) this really works
      !  . no eye strain here , also you can copy paste , translate ( buy google translate
      client and use it , it can translate any word from any app using google translate
      services ) \n\nThe other screen has your :\n- IDE so you can quickly try anything
      you want. \n- your Mindmap (mindmup wepapp for me ) . connect what you just
      learned to other pieces in nodes in a mind map ( that is a good reading technique
      actually , but it is off topic, ) , btw I am new to web world so this is the
      mindmap I am building since a while to help me to understand all this sh***
      about web https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1HHYY6hz4ErZmozZ1RWaFNMVTQ/view?usp=sharing\n\n-
      and your notes taking app ( one note ) . to copy paste search results some parts
      of the PDF ..etc \n\nand Finally you MUST really have a pencil and a paper in
      your hand all the time while reading when your hand is not on the keyboard.
      while reading , draw shapes and write a \"mental model\" of what you just learned
      to paper. believe me when I tell you that the type of the pencil and the paper
      makes a difference, the paper shouldn't be so soft. use ( دفتر المربعات القديم
      ده )  , it has a cheap type of paper that is not soft. and use ( قلم رصاص بيتبري
      مش قلم سنون ) , B1 please :D , or just try different combination of pencil and
      papers that satisfies you, at the end,  there should be a a good feedback feeling
      from scratching on papers , there is really some kind of connection between
      your mind and the feedback feeling you get from drawing and scratching on paper
      , just try it. \n\nso Two LCDS + paper and pencil + translate app + note taking
      app + mind map app"

    message: I prefer paper books, but since buying books isn't the economic solution,
      I tried reading on netbook 10.1" and my Samsung. I used to dim the netbook screen,
      install light-weight text editor(sublime) with compiler and was fine to have
      code practicing while reading.. later on I was in need for quick access to some
      topics or chapters without the hassle of having PC environment, I found this
      great application (Moon+ Reader) on Android, It's built to be fully customized
      with reading environment. I use it in office and transportation, and keep the
      netbook for reading in home. Both are good solutions for me.

      to cover reading is also best on a screen for me.
