    message: "More than three years ago I was at your position, but I wasn't free
      for some extent due to I ought to study C++ due to an academic course. \n\nAfter
      that I searched online, how best universities around the world put their students
      at the begin of programming way. And I found two schools here out: \n\n1- Some
      says that the best start point is to start with (Python) \"Which is very closed
      to Ruby, so they thought as you did precisely\". At the top of universities
      who follow this track you will find Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
      the best university in mathematical applications around the world, and here
      is the introductory course they study: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/\n\n2-
      Another approach is to start with (C++) \"or sometimes C\". And at the top of
      universities who follow this track you will find Stanford University the best
      university in Artificial intelligence and Algorithmic applications around the
      world. but I can't find it online yet. \n\nI like the second approach more,
      may be because I forced to follow it and found it interesting and useful. But
      the main reason is that you will need to learn more programming languages later
      such as Java, C#, JavaScript and/or PHP. And C++ syntactically is more similar
      to these languages' syntax than Ruby or Python. \n\nBut a very helpful fact
      that you should recognise before starting is that you will need to learn almost
      all of these programming languages: http://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-should-a-modern-day-programmer-have-in-his-her-arsenal\n\nFinally,
      if you are a computer science student, I think you should master this course
      before learning any programming language. It's a self study introductory course
      to the computer science with no deadlines as a field and which you will face
      in your extremely interesting and informative journey: https://class.coursera.org/cs101-selfservice.\n\nHope
      it's helpful, and if there are any other questions I'm in demand :)"

      أتوقع البوست بتاعك اتمسح، و البوست ده كمان ممكن يتمسح (أنا كأدمن موافق لو نفس الأدمن اللي مسح اللي فات عايز يمسح ده كمان)، لإن السؤال من أنواع الأسئلة اللي الصفحة هنا بتتجنبها. مافيش حاجة اسمها ايه رأيكم في الروبي. كله شغال.

      هنا مش مكان سؤال المبتدئين العام، و خصوصا مش مكان ايه رأيكم أشتغل بروبي ولا لأ. فيه ألف جروب للكلام ده على فيسبوك.الجروب ده حريص ما يبقاش الألف وواحد و يبقى مكان أنسب لأسئلة و مواضيع المحترفين اللي ليها معنى و إجابة.

      أنا أسف من سخافة الرد لكن لزم التوضيح.

    message: Mohamed Meligy I did know this was a joke. I think the idea here is to
      try to explain to people that technologies are all valid and useful, so we need
      to focus on the right place and time to uuse each one instead of having the
      repetitive religious debate. The reason I knew it was a joke is because you
      said we don't like language wars unless they involved Ruby or Python, so he
      just played along with that

    message: Actually, after another thought. Obviously several people replying didn't
      think it was a joke and replied seriously. That's why the warning is still important,
      although I take back my opinion for deleting the post, because as I said, it's
      valid as a joke (a very practical one that several commenters fell for!).

    message: Well the group is called Egyptian "Geeks" and as the namesake implies,
      we are geeks i.e. people who love and enjoy technology, we don't necessarily
      have to be gurus or experts, but what brings us together is a love of learning.
      Some geeks are new at some things and experts at others. The idea of "experienced
      professionals" is more at odds with the word "geek" cause a geek does not have
      to be a professional (make money out of his geekdom), but rather someone who
      does things for the fun of it. And geeks usually have odd sense of humors, which
      is why we have to be more accomodating. As for not starting an "Us vs Them",
      I totally agree and understand that the message has been made clear, I was even
      one of the people relaying it.

      I think that is what happening here.
