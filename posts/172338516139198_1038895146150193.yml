message: Forget about the cheesy title, do you agree that React is better than AngularJS,
  as a tool ?! I am a HUGE AngularJS fan, and I don't see how on earth React is better
  than Angular. What to you think ?

      Angular can't win all fights on all battlefields :)
      I'm a fan also but I think angular fits best at small to medium apps other wise something else needs to play the role.
      React is impressive and still young and full of prospects but its not clear at least for me that it already won!

      perhaps some cool utility functions here and there and shorter syntax to achieve
      specific tasks.

    message: Ok, a point I think needs clarification, A Framework has to use inversion
      of control, it must run first and call your application, like the Spring Framework
      for example. A Library is something that is called by your application and it
      does NOT run independently. With well designed frameworks and AOP (Aspect Oriented
      Programming), you can make your application framework independent. BUT, this
      requires proper design with accurately documented Pointcuts. A good framework
      will work with POCO/POJO Objects and the framework does it's magic through xml
      or runtime configuration or AOP. I would encourage you all to look at Spring
      as a great example of that, and I believe that Java is more advanced that .NET
      in this aspect, although it would not be impossible to have a framework in .NET
      (.NET framework :) ) that can do similar functionality.

    message: Also, Functional programming vs OO. There is a time and a place for both
      and the best is to usually mix both approaches. It is also my opinion/prediction
      that in the future, more advanced and cleaner subsets of Javascript will become
      popular e.g. coffeescript but withh a significant following and possibly a new
      syntax.

    message: I spent some time fiddling with React, I hated it! I know now I am using
      AngularJS for the right reasons. For me it's more of a lifestyle rather than
      a framework! Since I knew about it, It changed how I do and build things, I
      JUST LOVE IT, the way it's. I even afraid I wont like AngularJS 2 with this
      weird new syntax
