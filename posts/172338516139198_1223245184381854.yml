message: "Is DNS hijacking related to telephone centrals here in Egypt?\nmultiple
  times I found my router with strange dns ips\nsometime even its firmware is being
  played with.\ncan't find any malware in my pc .\n\ntl;dr;\nsometimes in my area
  me and my friends connected to the same telephone central get redirects to adware
  pages when visiting some specific websites i.e.(facebook, google). sometimes nothing
  is reachable. and of course the chronic click-popups in any website. I use the same
  devices in my network, in different network in different area and I don't get any
  adware or click-popus. \nI reset my router to factory settings multiple times but
  this issues just keep coming back!\nI had this issue using ubuntu 12/14/16 windows
  7/8/8.1/10 and android.\nthe last adware DNS server ip forced to my router was:
  79.143.82.186\nclick popups redirects to wonderlands.com with urls like this:\nwonderlandads.com/afu.php?zoneid=437742\n\nthought
  I would share this with you if you have any useful info because I'm a total networks
  noob."

    message: It's a vulnerability in the router itself. Try to update it's firmware.
      It might help. You are correlating it to you re area, because whole ranges of
      IPs get attacked, and they are usually in the same area. This has been happening
      for years ..
