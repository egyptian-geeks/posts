      I once hard trouble making payments on Godaddy several years ago. Turns out
      they blocked payments from abroad. I used a free  VPN while visiting the website
      to make it look like I'm from the US and it worked!

      they don't accept "prepaid" visa/mastercard cards.
      you should use paypal

      I find the idea of entering credit card info while using a free vpn very scary, I think there are at least some kinds of ssl (ip-based i think) that has to be decrypted then re-encrypted by the VPN, so I woldn't personally do that besara7a :D
      (if it's perfectly safe, correct me :D)
