message: "Hi there , \nI am a senior PHP Developer with 8 yrs Exp.\n\ni was called
  three days ago for a job interview i did not apply for (they get my resume from
  some website)\n\ni was asked if i used joomla before and if i write code documentation
  \ .\n\nI told the interviewer that i did not do any previous work with joomla as
  i always build Platforms and big systems from scratch and Most of the Joomla Bootstapping
  Core is an added load i do not need specially with big traffic sites ,\n\nthe second
  question about documentation , i said i never wrote documentation because i was
  never asked to , but if i would be asked , i can do this as it is a very easy job
  but a time consuming. \n\nwhen the interview came to the part where i should show
  him my code and my previous work , he was on a hurry an he just said i will call
  you .\n\ni really do not know why such people - calling themselves multi national
  companies - are not estimating the value of our time .. we prepared .. came in time
  .. postponed our duties .. why ? he could have asked by phone if i used joomla or
  made documentation before !!\n\nI do not think that all PHP programmers in FACEBOOK
  co. or Google inc. used joomla or Done the Documentation part before .\n\nwhat do
  you think ?"

      Alaa New I do not think so , i think he needed that Full stack one with the joomle and docs :) BTW i am not talking about accepting me -as i really did not apply/want the job-  i am talking about rudeness in ending the interview :)

      when i was showing him an example of my work : it is a big site to be launched soon , something wrong happened in the site , he behaved as if he is the winner of the great cup saying " this seems to be buggy code full of bugs .. alot of bugs " .. i tried to stop laughing .. but i could not ... i really do not know why did he behave like this :)

    message: Just before we start getting hot headed, the best practice in my humble
      experience is to have the code be self documenting, and the documentation can
      be generated either with a code generator or some other tool when needed. The
      documentation produced by a human should just be the main structure and the
      patterns used. the rest can be produced by a machine if the code is written
      properly.

      Ahmed Al-Amir , Muhammad AlHaqqani .. i agree with you , if it is just some thing to write and go .

      Sometimes Clients require fully Documented product with every method and response explained and every variable type and value expected .. specially when applications are required for banking or communication companies ...

      Ahmed Al-Amir ... The code is 90% understood so the person returns me just in some cases he wanna make sure of ... he could be a programmer or have a coding background .

      we write comments on our code as directions for him too.

      Guys , i am taking here about heavy duty documentation .. not the usual ones , where you could generate or fulfill in 3 pages :)
