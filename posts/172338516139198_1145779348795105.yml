  OH MY GOD what an amazing invention!, how we never thought of that before!

  Live long enough in this field and you will see history repeating itself. For those of you, who are young enough that their first email was @gmail.com, Back in the olden years we used to install Apps on our computers too. Then they invented a miracle called instant applications that run in the browser, they called it Web Applications.

      In order to imagine how annoying this sounds to someone who whitnessed the client/server era. Imagine reading the following in 10 years:

      2020 News: Google invents a new layout engine called "Google Boxes" it automatically reflows the application UI so you can be resized

      2030 News: Google releases the latest Nexus ArtistX, and it runs Android L (Lolita), and it comes with a pointing device, they call it the RAT. and an amazing state of the art huge 20" display.

    message: To be fair I have not learned the details of the whole system yet, and
      sure it might have its uses for Apps that need to capture from camera or mic
      or GPS or other hardware. But still, this effort would have been better directed
      to the browser

    message: It's not web apps, it downloads a small part of the Android native app
      and runs it. You'll need to write your apps in modules to have it compatible
      with instant apps. Yes, their choice of the buzzfeed video app is stupid, but
      you forget the second, parking app, demo. You guys are missing the point here.

      I am not sure why people are so sarcastic about it?! Sony did something similar in PS4 where you can download just a fraction of the video game and start playing and it continuous in the background without you waiting to download 40 GB to start playing. WOW does the same.
      Basically imagine this scenario: you are building a custom app for a client, you need to implement a specific small feature that could be done in multiple ways, so you send 10 different apps in the store to the client so he can test the feature in these apps and tell you which experience he prefers the most.

      If the average app size is 50 MB and the client is using 3G connection, you are asking him to download 500 MB, but with this feature it maybe down to just 10 or 20 MB

      There are many applications for it, could be used in games, could be used in many apps, the good thing it exists

      This is different. This will download an activity from your application and run it. Not the whole app. But u will have to make this activity somehow able to run as a standalone.

      I know it is similar to a webpage, but you will have access to all the APIs provided to an app and won't depend of web browser capabilities
