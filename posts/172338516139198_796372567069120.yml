    message: as if it matters ... killing support isn't the problem, you can't get
      the users to update their old browsers because it is bounded to the OS updates
      which is disabled by most users who use pirated version.

      Of course it matters :) - I've heard a lot of times that "We need to support IE7 or IE8 cause this web app will run on corporate machines".
      And this will ensure that system admins will need (forced) to update the browser
      And in all cases it's a good news for all of the web developers

    message: Bro, this wont force them to update their browsers cause the machines
      they are using are not capable of running higher versions of IE cause of the
      OS itself :)

    message: We use IE7 at work ... and some people ask me to check stuff for IE6.
      Some agencies are required to support *all* browsers ... because of the sensitivity
      of their *content*.
