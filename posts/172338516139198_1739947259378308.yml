  How to handle difficulty levels in game ?

  I am making simple game(TicTacToe) &using Min-Max algorithm in my AI Agent this work good for complete Expert Agent but how to handle different levels of difficulty ?

  I defined "AI_Level" for every level I have(easy,med,hard,expert) then I use random number to indicate using the (min max )algorithm or (random move) due to the "AI_Level" for the current level .

  It looks fine there is obvious change in every level than each other but the Agent it self isn't stable sometimes looks genius sometimes looks dump (not in expert mode).

  Is there better solution  for this ?
  Thanks .

      One Idea is to consider the search tree depth as an indicator for the difficulty level.

      Meaning is that for the expert model you will go the whole search tree, for the med you will go only 3 levels, and for the easy you will go only one level.

      This will have mainly 2 advantages:-
      1- It will keep your searching algorithm(i.e MinMax algorithm) consistent, which is something you complain about as a side effect to your current method.

      2- I think the approach is extandable even for chess AI agents, which is a huge benefit if you think about it.

      Finally, the above is just old thoughts when I implemented the MinMax algorithm back in clg, so don't take literally. :))

      let us know your findings. :D
