message: "Hello, \nI have couple of questions regarding SSD to SSD migration process,\n1-
  are there migration tools from SSD to SSD tools? both of the SSDs are kingstone,
  the source is KS Fury X 120GB, the target is KS UV400 240GB.\n2- Can i use the Target
  SSD as my boot drive right off the bat without having to install windows and other
  software all over again? as all of my data is pretty valuable; whos not, but, its
  not my own personal data.\n3- is Kingstone UV400 240GB worth the upgrade? i already
  have Kingstone FuryX 120, but i m running out of space, and my budget only allows
  me to upgrade to UV400, cant wait for longer cause my C drive space is below 1GB
  most of the time, and i m aware of the danger i m running into if I left the SSD
  in such situation."

    message: regarding the migration process i have talked about, the EaseUS todo
      can handle that, and according to many articles it is feasible, i asked for
      lack of knowledge. the link of the tools is https://www.todo-backup.com/backup-resource/data-transfer/migrate-windows-10-to-ssd.htm

      buy directly from Amazon, it costs about 122$ including shipping+ taxes.

      it comes with a software that does exactly what you're asking about. clones your old drive into the new one.

      I have done this before:
      1. I have used "Macrium Reflect" it is free.
      2. Sure, It will be a clone just works as the old one
      3. Use "WinDirState" it will give you a map of the files on disk, will really help you in understanding space usage.

      Edit: you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Config to choose the new SSD as boot disk

      بص يابني انا عارف انت عملت ايه و عملت نفس الحاجة قبل كدا..
      حتجيب فلاشة و تحط عليها اوبونتو و تركب الهاردين.
      تشغل اوبونتو and use dd to image the partitions exactly the same way
      Masalan
      dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=4K

      This should create a clone of your old drive on the new one but be sure to adjust the device names and double check that you got the right one in input and in output.. Mistakes will erase your original hdd.
      Then boot your new hdd.. Just like the old one and run chkdsk on all partitions. Or fsck if you have ext3/4 parts. Then use gparted to chsck that the partition table is fine and create a new partition in your extra space that will be unallocated.

      Verify that the data is sound with an MD5 tool then format your old SSD and use it as storage or to shift around your partitions in case you need to rearrange things.

      If all this is too hard for you.. Check these cute GUI apps that will do the steps for you.
      https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_cloning_software

      I would recommend clonezilla.. You'd want a sector by sector clone for windows
