  What do you guys see Node js in Egypt after five years from now ?
  I am thinking to learn and master it but don't know How ?
  I need a full path to walk through it which lead me to become a professional Node js developer in a few period (5 months at least).

      I believe that Node is the future.
      I think the only way to master node is doing various projects. This is how you'll learn about new packages, application structure, etc..
      You can start with Expressjs then you can go for Meteorjs as a full stack framework.

      Like Mohamed Shaaban says, don't think of 5 years, you should learn with the expectation that you might need to learn a completely different thing after a year or two, and that is normal. We're developers not historians :D
      And yes, learn by doing, this is the best way to prove to yourself and others that you really did learn and understand.
