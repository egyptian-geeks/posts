message: "Hello folks,\nI'm trying to make a web service to help make a live video
  stream between multiple mobile devices (Android and iOS) using the same application
  (something like google hangout video)\nwell, I don't know how to begin or what to
  do. I tried searching a lot but I couldn't understand anything. I found something
  called Kickflip \n(https://kickflip.io/)\nbut I couldn't understand its mechanism.\nthe
  question here is : what is the mechanism of something like this to be developed
  as a web service ?\nAny suggestions for a library for this for Android and iOS ?\n\nNote
  : web service is developed using ASP.NET Web API"
