  Have anyone of you tried Bulma css? http://bulma.io/
  I think it would be nice to integrate into my Vue project as it doesn't depend on jQuery like bootstrap and semantic UI .. So I can completely control it within Vue .. I know I can use only the CSS parts of Bootstrap/Semantic UI and control them through Vue But I guess Bulma is more suited for this .. What do you think?

    message: I really find it difficult to justify the use of a CSS framework. Most
      of the designers we work with go crazy and create stuff that I can assure you;
      cannot be achieved by any existing frameworks. Frameworks are like an overkill
      for these kind of stuff. For the past 4 years I think I didn't use a framework
      except for stuff like dashboards ...
