    message: "Mohamed Samy that was the most misinformed comment I've seen so far
      this week. Congratulations, you just failed the Internet. You yourself could
      use some spell checking, a bit of grammar and a little less of conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's
      also worth mentioning that political correctness does not equate bad grammar.
      If anything, it indicates a certain level of social discipline so I applaud
      Tarek for that. \n\nTarek Amr It's not a geeks thing, it's a commonly debated
      topic in English and there are no right answers to it.\nThe topic is gender-neutral
      pronouns in your specific case if you're interested in searching for it and
      gender-neutral English for the broader topic. For the language enthusiasts out
      there, you can dive even deeper by reading about grammatical gender.\n\nThe
      usage of she as a gender-specific pronoun is not grammatically incorrect.\n\nIt's
      an old inherited issue with English, displeasure for the usage of a male oriented
      pronoun has been expressed (both socially and legally) a lot in the past 20+
      years enough for some linguists to call for the introduction of gender-neutral
      pronouns, but for what it's worth you could always use the singular 'they'.\nThat's
      common and it has been a consistent practice in English for decades.\n\nWhen
      in doubt, use what you feel more comfortable with. English literature is littered
      with gender-specific and gender-neutral grammatical structures. Some authors
      even alternate the pronoun gender by paragraphs.\n\nHope that cleared any confusion
      you had and apologies Mohamed if my tone sounded condescending, if it did then
      it probably was and that's the Internet. Don't dish it out if you can't take
      it."

    message: Emad Elsaid basically it's when you don't want to offend anyone or bother
      anyone so you go an extra mile to please them and then it ends up becoming a
      form of social hypocrisy. You know when on sitcoms they get 2 women marrying
      as lesbians, and the ex-husband of one of them is there at the wedding as "support"
      (e.g. friends) political correctness. When they talk that there is no diffrence
      between male and female and  they say men should stay at home and women work,
      political correctness. What bothers me about it is that it has gone so far as
      to change the classical grammer of a language. I found myself writing "s/he"
      all the time, to prove that I am not a "mysogynst" (another politically correct
      word). In the end, I found I have nothing to prove and neither do you. Unless
      you do something wrong or suspicious, you have a right to the benefit of teh
      doubt,

      Mohamed Samy well, that or you'd have to have some self respect and a will to save face. Apparently you're lacking on both... Once more you've displayed an enormous amount of misplaced ego, still failed to present a single credible reference stating that using "she" is grammatically incorrect and generally just made a fool out of yourself.

      Classical grammar? You surely must know that languages tend to evolve. Not to mention the fact that English never had a claim on a specific gender-specific pronoun being more correct than others or preferred for that matter.

      At the very least, spare yourself any further embarrassment and for the love of god, correct "grammer". The word is spelled with an "A" not an "E", and it's "misogynist" not "mysogynst".

      You're picking on someone's use of a language construct that you yourself fail to understand properly, not to mention fail to use the language properly. If you have an urge not to be inclusive while you address a group of people, that's on you, but if you plan on presenting an argument then do it right.
