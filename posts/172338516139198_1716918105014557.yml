message: Is a 720p laptop a bad idea as a laptop for coding? I read an article saying
  you shouldn't buy less than 1080p for a coding laptop.

      would be way better though you will be able to see more lines at the same time
      and if you are working with an IDE for screen wont get as crammed

      It's not a problem in itself, but it's a bad sign, and you should be careful when evaluating the machine.

      13" Macbook Pros for example have high resolution, but after applying Retina effect (High DPI, 200% zoom), it mostly acts like a super crisp 720p. And some people use that for development.

      But you need to be careful. Even that Macbook Pro has dual core CPU not quad core.

      In my experience, low resolution often comes in very bad displays. I'd never buy a 1366x768 laptop again. Not because the resolution is bad, but because all laptops with this resolution have horrible screens, not for resolution but for other things as well (eye strain, very bad color contrast, very low brightness, etc... you don't want to look at them).

      So, it's not a deal breaker, but it's a smell. Read more reviews about the screen of the laptop that you are considering, if people say it has a bad screen, it probably does. Also note other hardware limitations, for example, a dual core laptop will be OK for web development maybe, but not for work that needs virtual machines.

    message: "I used such laptops in 2010-2012, but when I switched to 1920x1080 and
      the to a Retina MacBook Pro, I never looked back. \nThis spec itself is not
      an issue, but it usually means the laptop specs are very low, and the panel
      is very low end, so unless you cannot afford a higher specs machine, avoid it,
      otherwise it is not a deal breaker"

      I talking to you from my 1080 laptop. and I can say with confidence for writing code 768 is better than 1080.
      1080 makes text very small and "sometimes" hard to read.. and sometimes you will enlarge text size.

      If you design UI or working with many GUI application in same time.
      an external 1080 screen with your 768 laptop screen is much better.

      If you can read small text without any problem then go ahead and buy the 1080 one.

    message: My advice don't go for lower than 1080p, just based on the fact that
      it would give you much more space vertically and horizontally for coding. I
      have a 1600x900 and it's a pain in the ass, so I can only imagine how bad a
      720p will be. The one before it was a 1080p and it was much better, especially
      for dev tools.

      Sometimes I code on my 1366x768 laptop, it doesn't hurt eyes anyway,
      I think dpi is what matters.. not the resolution of the screen,
      if you have a 15.6" (laptop screen size) with 720p may be better than a higher resolution but with 50" for example..
