      A popular technique related to that is "Pomodoro Technique". It's pretty popular that it should be easy to find apps / browser plugins for. https://www.google.com/search?q=Pomodoro+reminder+for+windows

      In the standard form of this technique you work for 25 minutes then take 5 minutes break. However, customizations like working 50 minutes and taking 10 minutes break are popular as well, and I think  are supported in many apps.

      If you consider other options besides native desktop OS apps, like browser extensions and phone apps, the range of stuff you can find using the keywords "Pomodoro app" will increase a lot.
