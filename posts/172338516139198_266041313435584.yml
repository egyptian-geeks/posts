    message: Xerox !! you can said that it is xerox if you recognize that GUI is only

    message: Yeah you right, steve is not a programmer and didnt know any thing about
      that, but he is a prototyper ... a very good visionary mind, shifted computing
      experience from bulky enterprise architecture into micro-architecture that can
      be used on our homes ...
