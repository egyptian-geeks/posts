  Guys, I have this idea to have a crowd funding to send our top Thanawya Amma Students to places like Harvard, Stanford and MIT.

  I already created the campaign and need a team to help.

  No social media influencers or inspiring people looking for publicity please. Those people, if they really want to help can share and donate anonymously please.

  If you are interested in helping, please ping me with your email.

      Ugh...

      I don't think they would even accept the idea. Let alone the fact that you need to issue VISAs to these people. The difficulties beside money are way, way more insurmountable.
