  Anyone here have a deep understanding of  hidden markov models (viterbi algorithm), conditional random fields or recurrent neural networks and their applications in pattern spotting from a continuous stream without explicit segmentation?

  Thanks

    message: "The plethora of terminologies you've included in your post. It's like
      Ask Jeeves all over again but without NLP. \n\nJust when you think people would
      stop calling sentence parsing + word graphing and some dependency graphing an
      NLU system... /rant\n\nEdit: See what I did up there? Lol..\n\nAnyway, what
      we know about your post now, is that you're attempting to do some sort of pattern
      spotting on a continuous stream of entities that have no clear segmentation.
      Uh, okay... And?\n\nAre you building a keyword spotting system? Everything you've
      said in the post aligns with that. RNN, viterbi algorithms, continuous stream
      (of text, I presume). \n\nThrowing a bunch of buzz words together without an
      clear intent or a solid technical question is hardly a good conversation starter."

      Thanks for replying :)

      Sorry for ambiguity, the continuous stream represents a one dimensional analog signal, i've some meaningful patterns that might occur within the continuous stream, these patterns have temporal variations (not fixed time), i.e pattern #1 could take 5 ms or 7 ms or 10 ms, but the overall shape of the pattern in the same.

      what i want to do is to make live decoding for the continuous stream into a series of meaningful pattern classes given that, i don't know how to know where each pattern will begin or end in the continuous stream , also the stream might have non meaningful patterns that i'm not interested in and should discard from decoding.

      What i've currently implemented is a classifier that can classify any of these patterns given that the signal has a defined beginning and ending,

      This guy does Neural Networks -> Mohab Elkaref
      Not sure about the other buzzwords though :D
      Edit: after giving it more thought, I feel this might not be close to his field of focus, but let's see.

      that I know of are (1) a speech recognition system that uses a combination of
      Long Short-term Memory (lstm) networks together with a bi-directional RNN. Look
      for a paper authored by Alex Graves and some Canadian guy. (2) The PhD dissertation
      of Felix Gers. He used LSTMs as well to predict random spikes in a continuous
      signal. You can download his cpp code for that, but its an absolute bitch to
      read. \n\nCan't help you out much with HMMs I'm afraid, but if I were you I'd
      explore them further IF I was comfortable with Support Vector Machines.\n\nHope
      that helps."
