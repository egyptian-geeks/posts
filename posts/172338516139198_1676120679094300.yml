    message: I have heard so many mixed reviews.. some say it's pretentious and showy
      and others say it's very good for connecting and listening to new ideas.. i
      honestly decided to give it a try myself this year and try to pick workshops/sessions
      that interest me.

    message: I would say experience it for yourself, you don't just have to ask this
      question. Simply spend some time there, possibly a day and attend some of the
      sessions that seem interesting to you. Maybe even a session you don't think
      sounds interesting out of curiosity. In the end, it is always the speaker, never
      the event. I used to enjoy the very old MDC because I would meet old friends
      there.  Some people will be there for networking, some people I saw are speakers
      and I don't even understand what experience they have in the first place to
      be a speaker, some speakers seem to be valuable, others seem to be speaking
      just to get their name out there.

    message: I just saw that the tickets are quite expensive, of that is the case
      for you, I would only attend if there was a benefit I could personally see for
      myself, otherwise, all courses are online and there is a lot of knowledge out
      there
