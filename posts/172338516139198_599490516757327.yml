message: today was the 2nd workshop day at the office we made like startup weekend
  but we do it in 5 hours Only. and I would like to share with you something Fuck'n
  amazing! it's the UI ibrary of Firefox OS made for Mobile and well documented and
  the most complete UI library i have ever seen. the only problem they have is that
  because they made it for FirefoxOS they didn't add prefixes for other browsers so
  you cana dd them your self or use sass.
