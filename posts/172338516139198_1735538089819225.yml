      Clips camera is finally on sale.  At its Pixel 2 launch event last year, Google
      also revealed its tiny Clips camera, that uses AI to figure out when it should
      take a picture or video. Now the $249 device has quietly become available for
      purchase on its website, however as Android Police notes, it could take a while
      to arrive. Depending on the address used, I saw potential delivery dates between
      range between February 27th and March 5th.\nSo should you order one? While most
      cameras rely on your best guess about when to take a picture, Google Clips has
      had its AI trained by pro photographers. The 2-inch square has a shutter button
      12MP sensor, 130-degree field of view and 16GB of storage to save up to 3 hours
      of selected video. Chris Velazco was impressed by the results during our hands-on
      test in October, but we'll need more time to find out how good it is at sorting
      through daily life for the highlights, and if we feel secure with its strategy
      of sending the results to a paired phone.\n\nFollow us : @offshoreology\n\n#ai,
