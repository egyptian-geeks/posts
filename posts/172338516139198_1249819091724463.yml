      This is the Blue Coat Encrypted Traffic Management appliance, targeted to Medium Businesses and Enterprises, just think that the same company that now owns Blue Coat "Symantec" is the same one owning the most important Certificate Authority in the world "VeriSign" and has internal access to the private keys of the Root Certificates to most of the sites on the Internet.
      So just think if Blue Coat (or similar company) have a super-sized super-fat super-confidential contract with a government to supply ISP-sized equipment to do exactly what you are seeing, it is not even technically difficult anymore.

    message: Nope, these tools are-governments sized, but governments are not the
      only threat that needs encryption, and this is not related to all kinds of encryption
      (for example, if you want to stay Anonymous in the Internet, TOR is still very
      usable (not bullet-proof, but mostly good enough), if you need files encryption,
      VeraCrypt (one of the forks of TrueCrypt) is highly recommended, or use 7-Zip
      and just make password-encrypted .7z archives.

      most probably a prank pulled by someone who was able to get a list of people's names and their phone numbers.
      As far as I know, to spy on https traffic you need a trusted certificate of some sort, and I think even that can be detected if you do certificate pinning.
      For the end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp though you need to intercept the initial key exchange, and even that can be detected by meeting your friend in-person to see if the keys match. I've read however that someone could change the key mid-conversation and WhatsApp wouldn't tell you by default, you can however go to Settings > Account > Security to make WhatsApp notify you when such a thing happens.

      I assume it's a prank, end to end encryption so far proved strong ability of defeating any trials to intercept message between both sides, even from the ISP itself.
