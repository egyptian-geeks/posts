  So, following what Adel Khalil did, let's add my post as well.

  I'm a 17 years old web developer, started UnliCrea around a couple of years ago. I worked on a lot of projects including the web platform for Concerned Joe and I released an opensource version of the whole thing. We self-fund ourselves by freelancing on oDesk.

  I got an internship at eSpace last July and right now I'm working on the project we were working on then. It's an iOS game made using Swift. It's also a clone of another game I created earlier using ActionScript 3 during NewGrounds Game Jam 9.

  There are a lot of other stuff to add but I'd rather keep it short. So yea, who'd like to AMA?

      Actually it was a couple of projects and unfortunately they both failed. The first one was our first project ever, it was a new programming language using artificial intelligence. You would be able to teach your computer and code it by talking to it. We wanted to extend beyond that, where you could teach a robot how to dance for example. The project was already created, and has been up for around 18 years or so.

      The second thing was a flash game where you had to code to pass the levels. There were not so many libraries at that time that could parse code, or let's say that we were not experienced enough to make something that big. It ended up as being too big for us so we just discontinued the project.

      And then we extended past the point of "teaching people programming" when we released CIE Results and started working on big freelancing projects.

      Well, just be honest.

      On oDesk everyone's deceiving and everyone's lying and everyone wants money even if it's dirty and stained with dishonesty. That gives you a very, very sharp edge and an incredible chance to excel.

      On my first job ever my rate got tripled because of how honest I am. Things get even better when you finish stuff reasonably fast, or well, let's just summarize it in 6 words, "when you stop being a bastard". As long as your language is good, your work is clean, your speed is okay, you're not stealing anyone's money, you make sure everything's working, it'll be easy.

      And don't get bored. Keep applying and you'll get one of the jobs.

      Also, if you're a starter, don't get bloated. Remember that you don't have any reviews there yet and you don't have anything to make you special except your rate, so keep it low until you get a neat number of reviews and then increase it reasonably.

      I started learning Visual Basic at school in the fifth grade. When I was 13 I joined an academy that taught programming. I learned C++ and problem solving there. At the same time I was learning Objective-C because I was crazy enough to think that vimov would accept my application. It took me a year but I learned everything about OOP, thanks to Stanford's CS193p course, and vimov's QA manager, who introduced me to it.

      A few months later, around the beginning of 2013, I learned PHP because I wanted to implement CIE Results, and again I was crazy enough to apply for a freelance job. According to the guy, I actually did a job he's been investing in for 2 years, in a couple of weeks, and I had only few months of experience in PHP, if not weeks. I kept going and by the end of the year I was a Startup Weekend Alexandria participant who knows around 8 programming languages.

      Starting UnliCrea has another long story but I'd like to mention that the first time I paid for the hosting and the domain I used my "3edeyya".

      And also, again, there's a lot of details missing here, like other internships I applied for and got rejected, or other projects including other programming languages such as that Python-PHP socket I made which used to parse Python code. That was around October 2012. However, if I added everything that would make this comment huge.

      My own approach is a bit different. I literally have a list of projects and whenever I finish working on one, whether it fails or succeeds, and I have some time to work on another, I just pick another project from there and start working on it. I rate them by how promising they are. And it doesn't matter what does it require. That list actually includes hardware stuff. Although I prefer web development, I'll just dive in and learn whatever it requires and do it.

      Doing that succeeded for me, just start working on it and keep fixing bugs until it works and until you learn how does it work.

      Adel K. Khalil: I forgot to answer a part of your question, sorry about that.

      First of all, being an intern at eSpace was extremely motivating. I was their youngest intern ever. On the other hand, I didn't really enjoy the enterprise style. I wanted something more messy and more risky. I feel comfortable there right now because working on the game itself is a risk. A single developer working on a game that isn't backed up by a client paying for it is extremely risky, let alone the fact that this single developer is 17 years old, and the language used to develop the game is 7 months old. For example, it lacks static variables. Seriously. Declaring a static variable in Swift returns an error that says "Class variables are not supported yet." Seriously.

      They're extremely, extremely friendly, and they're definitely one of the best places anyone can work at. I'm proud I could get a chance to work with them, and I feel grateful that I'm still being there.

    message: normal mint is Ubuntu based, DE is Debian based so it gives you an easier
      vwersion of Debian but you still have Debian as the base, lighter less resources
      and fully open source. Ubuntu's main sponsor is a company called Canonical.
      I think Debian is more Organic and also more customizable.

      Ubuntu is built on Debian as well but what they're trying to do with LMDE is to build a clone of Linux Mint yet they're skipping the whole Ubuntu phase.
