  For the .NET guys, when I saw an earlier post about Entity Framework issues, I remembered that I know things like Futures (sending multiple queries in one DB call), and second level caching (caching DB results in memory seamlessly) do exist with extensions for EF, but I wasn't sure if they exist for EF Core as well.

  Google led me to this page http://www.zzzprojects.com/entity-framework-cache, and there I found this very nice looking gem for those interested in playing with it, supports .NET 4.x EF, and EF Core!
