      times find yourself trying to figure out how to do things on windows, and it
      might be actually harder.\n\nThe only reason I have a dual boot Windows is because
      the MS office suite is much better on Windows, and 3d modelling software like
      SolidWorks is simply not there for Mac. Other than that, working on a Mac is
      just a more pleasant experience."

      A mac with a vagrant box running linux and you get the best Web Development environment ever.

      General speaking if you gonna develop web then Mac book Pro with the same specifications
      as Y700 will perform better.

      From an ex-microsoftie (who traditionally would be voting against Mac), if you can afford Mac, buy without a single moment of hesitation because:

      1- Hardware is way more superior even when compared with other laptops with similar or even slightly better configurations

      2- Customer support is second to none. Problem with companies like Lenovo that if you have a problem and tried to contact customer support, you would be in royal pain being thrown between them, microsoft, your local dealer, etc.

      3- You still can install windows natively and have dual boot, while in the other way around, you can only install Mac OS using hackintosh which is basically a non-supported hack that could create a lot of problems specially if you are trying to build something for iOS or Mac Store

      4- Your laptop would pretty much be the same after 3-4 years of heavy usage. With most of other brands, they tend to disintegrate for a no given reason (lost keys, broken plastic, etc.)

      5- Macbooks have a great reselling value even if you sell them after a decade, while all other brands are pretty much worthless once you use them for just few months.

      I have been using Macs since 2006 and never looked back.

      Ok, first of all, I love macs, for their hardware and OS.
      BUT as a web developer of 16 years, I would never get a macOS for development. And when i did, I regretted it.
      No matter what dev tools & environments they make available for macs, you will always find yourself needing to use some tool or environment that is windows only, requiring you to install a VM or try to dual boot, which the mac isn't very good at.
      You will almost never require a macOS only tool or environment unless you decide to develop iOS only apps, which is almost never the case.

      It used to be for example that environments like dot net and Databases like mssql were only available for windows, but I hear now they ported some of them to the mac, however I would venture a guess that the windows version would probably be better maintained.

      As a general rule, mac is not a reliable software development platform, it's more of a Graphics platform, and even there it is lacking in top 3D tools like 3d studio and maya. If you want maximum compatibility go for windows.
