      i had a bad experience with PayPal, godaddy and some other big firms, they were canceling the transactions , as they said it was about the required information in the PayPal account doesn't fit with their standard,
      and they asked for standardize the PayPal account info with their standard
       i'm talking about an american Paypal account, how it will be with an egyptian one
      to be more honest outside godaddy and those big firms, PayPal is working as well

    message: It makes sense that the account info in PayPal match the info used to
      register a domain. In either ways, you are supposed to be the same legal identity
      whether yourself or a legal entity like a company.

      there is no matching for the account info in any credit card with the registration info, anyone can use anyone else credit card or any online paying way with different infos, they don't match this, it was about the provided data in the Paypal itself has missing infos and that makes the Paypal account itself doesn't fit with their standard
      they asked for a personal Photo and copy of the social ID which are not required in Paypal and some other infos
      the point is they canceled the transactions after it was already done, and that put me in alive problem , cause i already published a web project after a week it was not exist the transaction has been canceled, it took time for them to cancel it cause they check the Paypal infos manually

    message: Several people experience false positive "fraud" audits from different
      companies especially web hosting. I don't think it's PayPal specific (maybe
      in your case it happened to be), although I'm not 100% TBH.

    message: it's not about the hosting or whatever you do with the Paypal , it's
      about the nature of the Paypal account type , it's not like the Master card,
      the master card you do through a back account, the social ID is one of the basic
      requirements for the bank account, but the Paypal account is something you do
      online, simply the Paypal itself doesn't ask for the real identity and that's
      really cool but some companies like godaddy don't like that.
