  About API designing, I am always confused when to use "Delete" versus " Remove" as method name, or when to use Size, Length, or Count for Property/Attribute name.
  Is there any tips or resources to help me select the right naming convention, Thanks in advance.

      I havent heard of an HTTP method called "Remove" does it really exist ? I cant find it also in the HTTP protocol 1.1 RFC http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-2616.txt

      And as mentioned above, here is google api design guide https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/
