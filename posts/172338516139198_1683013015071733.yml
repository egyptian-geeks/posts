  How do you generally deal with burnout ?
  After working on several projects where i didn't get the chance to have any breaks or weekends. i fell totally exhausted mentally and physically, mentally for the most part.
  I've tried to take some time off - two weeks so far - yet can't get myself up.
  Any thoughts ?

    message: Burnout is a state that stays with you for a period, if you can take
      more time off, do it,  if you can decrease the amount of workload on you, do
      it, if your company tends to overwork you and you can handle leaving it, start
      looking for other companies

      Depending on the level of stress you've been under, two weeks might not be enough. And when you come back to work you need to start working on something interesting to you or at least new, not the old projects you were working on or at least not all of them at once.

      It will eventually pass, trust me. However the lesson you should learn from this is not to put yourself in this position again, if it's because of the company, change it. if it's because of yourself (that was my case when I was younger... a lot younger) then you need to control yourself and not take on too much work. Burnouts are real and a good manager knows how to prevent his/her engineers from reaching this stage.

      Thanks much, that was really helpful.
      I guess the best way to deal with burnouts is to avoid it in the first place as mentioned above.
      However for now  I'll be traveling for a week somewhere new, guess it's the best choice to go for.
      Thanks alot for the support, I really appreciate it :)
