  \nmay a proof : I just trace our IP and hostname the trace going outside egypt and
  stalled and failed openSSH handshake in ip (10.36.11.69) thats owned by iana \"icann.org\"
  (https://myip.ms/info/whois/10.36.11.69) which responsible in timezones configs
  to linux machines and confused in past july from Egypt due to the DST cancellation
  (http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2016-July/023851.html) \n- the ssh connections
  with our router is succeed at once we reconfigure the time last week ,but today
  it fails again. may but I just think the datetime in many of machines/or routers
  which owned by Tedata not reconfigured yet.\nalso traced the tedate and had the
  same timeout but reconnect with server localized in france \"may it is a proxy server\"
