    message: I think the interpreted languages war is over (pretty much all languages
      wars were over about a decade ago but that's a whole other story). The language
      itself doesn't really matter if you'll end up using a framework anyway so the
      comparison should be between frameworks not languages. I'm biased towards Python
      so I'll tell you to use python/Django for the blah blah blah blah reasons, another
      member of the group is a "code artisan :P" who likes Ruby will give you a different
      set of reasons to go for RoR. That's all crap IMHO, What you should do is layout
      a basic system architecture based on your business goals and then match this
      system to the most appropriate environment, you might surprise yourself at the
      end and use a completely different approach other than both.

    message: i would prefer Python, for me Ruby culture seems a lot like spaghetti.
      frameworks like django seems to have a better architecture. i was playing with
      RoR i can admit it has high productivity, and there are alot of gems that do
      the heavy lifting for you. its fast in case you want a quick prototype, but
      i would vote for python for real production projects, since it would be easy
      for teams to debug and work on.

    message: depend in your need you could use many language and many data structure
      in same project "like using java + python " and using cassndra + mysql + mongodb  every
      tool have a advantage and disadvantage Big boys like "Google , etc " do this
      even they invent tools for spacial cases < don't limit your self in one Box

    message: python with no doubts, eng Mohamed Alaa El Din said he does not recommend
      it, with all do respect, python could handle big projects if its constructed
      right, besides he is asking if he should use ruby or python.
