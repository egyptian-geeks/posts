      Interesting! I've personally avoided using "this" in JavaScript because I found it confusing (and doesn't really mean what it should mean if JS was a normal language).
      But what about normal DOM Events (without using jQuery) like:
      <div onclick="myFunc(this)" />
      wouldn't "this" be the div I clicked on? or will it still be the "window"?
