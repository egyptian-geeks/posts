    message: If you are going legal from day one, then yes by all means. But it does
      not have to be an apartment, you can rent a shared space and still get legal
      papers.

    message: As far as I know, you need to be renting a place to register the company.
      However, you can have a virtual office that can legally act as the company secretary
      & their address can be registered as your business address. There must be companies
      in Egypt doing that. Just do some research.
