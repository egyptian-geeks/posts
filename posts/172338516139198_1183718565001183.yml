message: 'SSL Interruptions: good evening fellows, some of you might be aware/suffering
  from SSL-connections drops/interruptions. There are different problems reported
  among technical communities in Egypt over the past 9 days revolving around targeting
  SSL connections (VPNs targeting, packet drops, ssl mail server fail..etc). One clear
  thing is lack of understanding as we don''t have a consistent pattern to talk about
  (examples of interruption include different IPs targeting, ISPs, mix of blocking
  techniques) and i cant tell for sure what is going on. I have seen and spoke with
  ppl who are going through total VPN-drops, frequent ssl-mail-server fail..etc and
  some companies/institutions have total vpn failure for the last 48hrs till now.
  Basically there are different difficulties related to secure connections but no
  solid explanation yet and no hint what is going on.. the general sense of course
  is SSL interception either by MITM-server or DPIs but no any sort of evidence so
  far. I thought of bringing it up here so we can share our problems we are going
  through and maybe our collective problems help in reaching a pattern to understand
  and hopefully resolve it, and maybe any of you can share a possible explanation.
  Thank you.'

      My work depends on a lot on accessing VPNs. Over the past few months, I had several incidents of apparent traffic throttling for OpenVPN traffic from several locations. I haven't been able to make any PPTP connections at all. Later OpenVPN issues were gone, but still no PPTP.

      I worked around this using SSL tunnelled OpenVPN. Until the recent issues. I was completely unable to connect to two OpenVPN servers. One with SSL, and one vanilla. After investigation, he re are my findings:
      - This behaviour is consistent over multiple providers. This usually means someone "higher" in the network path is doing it.
      - With the recent issues. I found that I can actually connect to my servers. I found that TLS auth/handshake packets are being dropped after establishing the initial TCP connection. This strongly suggests DPI targeting SSL/TLS traffic.
      - Based on my testing, this is not applied on all traffic. I found that changing the IP address of the server resolved the problem. This suggests that they are working on a pre-selected list of addresses. TBH I was freaked out to realise this and that two of my VPNs are blocked.

      Friends have mentioned that they have seen some affected ssh connections, too. But I didn't test that myself.

      I second everything Mohamed El-Sayed mentioned. I may add a couple of findings:
      1. TEData just changed all of her routing IPs today. Currently I noticed that all hops inside Egypt are in the 10.x.x.x range. This isn't valid for noor.net till now. Yesterday it was all normal.
      2. Through TEData (I didn't test the others), the output of mtr sometimes gives an extra hop or two when tracing port 443 compared to port 80. This is mainly valid for facebook, but not google. needs much more testing.
      3. OpenVPN through stunnel is throttled to 1mbps, this is on noor network.

      My interpretation is that either we are facing a new survellience equipment being installed, or it was something secretly installed before but went crazy due to DST as it couldn't correctly interpret the TLS packets as it used to do, and they are currently fixing it. By all means this has to be a DPI with SSL MITM capabilities.
