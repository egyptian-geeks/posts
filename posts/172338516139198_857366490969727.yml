  Did you ever wonder what's the difference between a Geek and a Nerd?

  Also, message to geeks, did you bite off the head of a live chicken? No? Then don't call yourself a geek anymore until you do :D

  Back in the early 1900s, when traveling carnivals were popular, there was a performer called the "geek." His job was to perform bizarre and disgusting acts for the amusement of the locals. Notably, this included biting the heads off live chickens.
