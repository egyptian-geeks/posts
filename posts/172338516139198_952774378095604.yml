      Ashraf Abdel Aleem I have these questions for u:
      - Why did you drop your framework for another ?
      - What framework gave you the push to make the trade ?
      - What framework are you using now ?
      - Can i have a look at your old framework ?

      support for ORACLE DB and I hit the wall of supporting another DB rather than
      MySQL.\n2- ZF 1.6  was the framewrok that I had to deal with since I was a part
      of a teamwork.\n3- I am using CodeIgniter at the moment and I satisfy with it
      because of its increadible lightweight and looseness.\n4- Yes you can but it
      comes with a price dear :-) ... it's more than 180 hours of hard working."

      OK Ahmed Zain Mohammed, Let's make this conversation even more richer, how about to answer some of your questions?
      1- What's your FW?
      2- How did you evaluate the FW before decide to use it?
      3- What reason would make you change your FW?
      4- Did you ever start a new project from scratch, and was it giving you the feeling of power control?

    message: "Ashraf Abdel Aleem\nFirst of all, I NEVER USED A FRAMEWORK (or even
      a CMS !). But I like Laravel. \n\nSince I started coding with PHP (that was
      7+ years ago), I was never comfortable using someone else 's code, so I never
      bothered to learn to use a framework or a CMS. I always loved writing everything
      from scratch.\n\nMy first framework (I named it \"Unique\") was very simple
      and lightweight, I loved it so much and decided to use it and work more on it,
      hoping that someday I could open-source it and share it with the world.\n\nAfter
      3 years of development and about 10+ projects it became more sophisticated and
      elegant, I named it \"Zonda\".\n\nNowadays, it's more awesome than ever. And
      it's called \"Rhino\", it's basically an HMVC, but instead of the Model part
      I use something that I call \"DB Handlers\", and instead of the View i use \"Widgets\".
      \n\nRhino is so unbelievably fast, lightweight and secure. And it was intended
      to build Web Apps, not websites. I love this thing sooo much, here are some
      code sample:\n\n$clients = DB_Clients::whereNameLike(' ... ')->orderByName()->limit(10)->get(['name',
      'website']);\n\nDatabase\\Connections::get('master')->databases();\n\nDB_clients::backup();\n\n$dir
      = new Files\\Directory( ... );\n$dir->files(['php', 'psd'])->delete()->backup();\n\nPlus
      so much more ..."
