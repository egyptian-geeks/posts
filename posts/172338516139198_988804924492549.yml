      This is one of the earliest issues reported on bower and it seem like they fixed it: https://github.com/bower/registry/issues/4
      What's the error you are getting?

      It makes sense to register only public repositories into the public registry.

      Depending on "Why" you want to do this, you can choose from the following options

      - Open the repo for public if possible. Delete it quick if the reason for private is testing with no rubbish behind you.

      - Have a different repository just for the bower distribution artefacts. A lot of even public OSS projects do that. You can push to it manually or set it up in your build process.

      - Instead of a registry, just tell people to install the dependency from the git URL you have. Yes, bower can install dependencies from HTTPS private git repositories. I have done it before. I just stick the URL in the bower.json file and run bower install You can even specify branch name to pull from, or a specific tag.

      - You can have a private bower registry and get other people in your team to add manually. I could find a few articles about it with a simple search. I don't see much value of doing that over just installing from the git URL though.
