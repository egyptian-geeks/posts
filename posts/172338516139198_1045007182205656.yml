    message: '"supercomputer" seems to be just for propaganda .. however, this is
      cool, it''ll be the first "small computer" with gigabit ethernet capability
      (as far as I know). The good design choice here is using cortex A53 instead
      of the traditional A7, which seems to be the main driver of these new capabilities.
      But I think it might be more power demanding the the A7 ones (like RPi)'
