  Dear Geeks ..
  Based on your experience ..

  What (affordable) online software development training websites can you recommend to me ?

  Sites like : Codecademy - Treehouse - Code School

  I want to focus on back-end, server-side programming using JavaScript (NodeJS)
  and the MEAN stack in general

  Please focus on the word - affordable - because I'm still a student and I can afford a monthly subscription with a maximum of 30 dollars in budget

  NOTE : I want to WRITE CODE , NOT watch videos

  Thanks in advance

      YouTube is free
      You can find a lot of courses available on it, it will require some digging but that's part of learning I guess

      first you should read the entire YDKJS series and be comfortable with all the principles explained in it.

      get the hang of mongoDB: https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about

      node and express: https://www.edx.org/course/programming-web-javascript-pennx-sd4x, skip directly to the 4th week.
      ---OR---
      do this crash course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs

      angular: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2

      now if you're really not welling to watch any videos at all then you can just go through official docs and guides:

      node overview: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/
      mongoDB starting guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/
      angular tour of heroes: https://angular.io/tutorial
