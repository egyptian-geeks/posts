    message: Nabil Noaman i know about owasp & OWASP Cairo Chapterr  , also i know
      about Cairo Security Camp and they both do great work  but their activity as
      i have witnessed so far are events and courses not a community  , not even like
      here in Egyptian Geeks

    message: Perhaps that'd be due to the fact that the competitive spirit in such
