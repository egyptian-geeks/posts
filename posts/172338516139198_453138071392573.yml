  Windows 7 Tips And Tricks
  Do any one knows that when pressing shift key and then right click over any folder the popup menu shows new command "Open Command Window Here" which will open command prompt(cmd) with default directory will be this folder
  It was a tough operation in previous OSs
  Thank's windows 7 :)

    message: Not just Command Window, as a web developer if you want to add the folder
      as a site  to the web matrix imagine how many folders containing web pages much
      easier to open also you can open the folders as a separate process too.
