      The array requirement is a bit silly, but you don't need to use string[], just [] is enough, plus I almost always prefer to set that enum, not to None. My usual call is like:
       y.Split(new[] { ".." }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)

    message: I think Split is very much faster than Regex, I did not measure but Regex
      functions have more code, they validate the passed pattern and have other checks,
      it is not MSIL.. etc

      Yeah, I didn't even bother talking about that. You also need to escape any special characters in the "pattern", etc.
      Of course it has its place based on complicity and size though, but not for this one.

    message: You can make a helper method or an extension method to the String object
      and make it much simpler. I also think Regex class is much more advanced and
      have way more code that is not needed for simple split of string

  - description: Here, “tokens” will be an array of strings containing “Erik” and
      “Dietrich”. It’s not exactly Earth Shattering to tokenize a string in this fashion
      and some incarnation or another of this predates .NET, C# and probably even
      my time on this planet.
