      Kindly read the pinned post and update your post accordingly.
      I'll give this post an hour before I nuke it.

      Good luck.

      حلو وياريت اننا نعمل كدا, لكن أظن أسلوب انك  هتمسح اللى ميمشيش على الإقتراح
      دا مش صح."

    message: "That's understandable and certainly no one likes deleting anything in
      this group although some things just beg to be deleted.\n\nHowever, if the active
      members like Amr Ali Tealeb and many others whose contributions are very much
      valued, don't share their insights. \n\nThen we don't expect that other less
      active members would be inclined to follow along the same path. Which poses
      a problem.\nThe problem is in the consistent decline of post quality, this isn't
      a link sharing group, neither is it a place to post questions you can easily
      find their answers on Google if someone indeed invested the time to do so.\n\nWe
      set a high standard, I and many others do our very best to uphold it and expect
      others to do so. That way, everyone rises to the same bar. Those who can't,
      but show interest in improving, are helped.\n\nThe group is there for people
      of knowledge, to interact with those seeking knowledge. Knowledge on a personal
      level, a level you otherwise won't get from a link on HN/Reddit or an answer
      on Stack overflow.\n\nIf a post is outside what's deemed acceptable, it's given
      a proper buffer before being canned.\nI like the link, it's informative but
      if I apply that rule to X post, I will apply it to Z post. It's only fair.\n\nNothing
      gets deleted without a fair warning and nothing gets slammed down without constructive
      feedback.\n\nThe hope is, that people would interact. That's the whole purpose
      of the group."

    message: "Now Amr Ali Tealeb was kind enough to edit the post with a more informative
      message. \n\nNow if someone does a lot of backend development and isn't particularly
      familiar with the innards of .NET.\nReading \"the next generation of .NET on
      the Server\" would certainly know what this is all about and might get interested
      or ask a question about the current state of affairs in .NET, people's experiences
      and expectations...etc."

      Hady Ahmed: I totally agree on the concept especially on being a role model for other parties in the group.
      what I was insisting on is that explicitly pointing out that unless the post  has the proper description, I will delete it within 1 hour was not that good.
      I hope you got my point in a good way, as I got yours :)

      for not having a good description makes no sense to me at all.

    message: 'If you think it''s not clear (although the title of the link share says
      enough: ASP.NET vNext from Scott Hanselman), just write a description in the
      comment and ask the poster to edit the post, anything more isuseless and doesn''t
      help much more than asking to edit, unless you want memebers to be "afraid"
      of deleting their posts, I don''t think we want those members anyway.'

      Whether the title says enough or not is debatable, especially for anyone with little to do with .NET.
      Nonetheless, I don't disagree with both of you. I've indeed handled this poorly and I extend my apologies.
