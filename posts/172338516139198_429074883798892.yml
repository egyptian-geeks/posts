  WHAT IS MemSQL?

  MemSQL places data into memory and translates SQL into C++ for the utmost optimization in query execution. This enables MemSQL to write and read data at incredible speeds, and by offering a relational interface, you can unify the data you’d normally store in a short-lived medium—cache or key-value store—and place it directly into a database along with your existing data.
