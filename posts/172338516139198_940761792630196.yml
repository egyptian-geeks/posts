    message: A processor clock cycle takes a third of a nanosecond(assuming 3 GHz
      clock), so for some lines of code amounting to ~50-100 simple instructions,
      the runtime would be 33-66 nanoseconds (assuming 2 clocks cycles per instruction),
      so yeah, you can wrote some simple code and their runtime is less than a millisecond
      (or a microsecond even).

      the slowest part is usually fetching things from the memory, I think it's 1000 clock cycles or so.
      I'm mentioning this because I was asked about it in an interview recently so I wanted to share the knowledge :)
