  - description: "Simple fuzzy search algorithm similar to sublimeText\n\nthis is
      a simple algorithm to give a similar result\nas SublimeText search feature,
      if you don't use sublimeText\ni think you should just give it a shot from here
      :\nhttp://www.sublimetext.com\n\nto know more about fuzzy search you should
      check this wiki page:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_string_searching\n\nthe
      idea is simple, when you search for a text and you can't remember\nonly part
      of it or you miss some characters while typing the search should\nbe smart enough
      to show you what you're searching for, so your algorithm\nshould search for
      the query characters and allow any character to \nbe followed by any other character
      sequence.\n\nafter you get strings that contain your query the fuzzy why,\nyou
      should rank them, i choose the simple one, if you found your\nexact query your
      matching pattern will be the least of them in length\nand if another patter
      has query plus one character you missed it\nwill be the second in search, and
      so on.\n\nso i sorted ascending order by the matching pattern length.\n\na smarter
      algorithm should check if there are 2 matching and get the best one\nalso should
      check if you wrote a wrong character, and if you switched two characters\nand
      so on of the operations mentioned in wikipedia.\n\ngist : https://gist.github.com/9484194"
