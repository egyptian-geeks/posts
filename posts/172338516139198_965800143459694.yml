  What do you think of this ?
  How do one check if his router is vulnerable to such hacks ?
  "This is important, there's a Botnet on the internet right now that will infect your PC/mobile and then infect your router then redirect all your internet traffic into a page that will say your service has stopped because you're suspected of being a robot, and will ask you to use a telecom company scratch card (etisalat, mobinil or Vodafone) to reactivate your service.
  This page is a scam and untrue, when this issue happen to you just reset your router and reconfigure the configs recommended by your ISP
  TEDATA doesn't need and will never verify if you're a human or a robot because they don't care.
