      it again if you don't want to store your images on their servers

    message: Yeah I installed BTSync but as far as I know it p2p only, meaning that
      2 or more of your synced devices need to be online so your files can move (no
      server to hold them for you), so it's not that useful for a simple laptop +
      phone scenario (as it will consume a lot of your data plan)
