      It depends on how smart your solutions are.
      But definitely it's something you should be showing off, like open source contributions

    message: "its okay if your answers are relevant to some specialized topics given
      that you can cite your answer in many situations.\n\nI don't know how ranking
      should be interpreted however .. but I am sure that there are many outstanding
      people that do not participate in stack overflow. \n\nso consider stack overflow
      ranking as one of your weapons .. but not the only one nor the finishing blow
      one."

    message: IMO its fine to show your work and be proud of as long as you put it
      in the right context and you don’t make a bigger deal than it is.

    message: Actually this is nothing than getting more experience in difficult and
      easy stuff so you'll more experienced but on the same side you're kinda wasting
      your time on a glory that is not important to any one except if a company interested
      in getting the top ranked people in stack overflow, and by the way if i'm choosing
      between you and someone made some project I would take him to work in a project
      and you as an assistant to help him or to audit the code.
