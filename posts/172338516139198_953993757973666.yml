    message: Umbraco (and other similar products) work on Freemium model and are really
      meant to be purchased. DotNetNuke is very old and bad investment IMHO (I did
      very little work on it in 2012 on legacy app and really hated it). Your only
      option is Orchard.

    message: If you consider removing the "Free" criteria, Umbraco seems to be the
      preferred CMS for design agencies that have to work with a .NET CMS. If you
      stick to free and you want a .NET CMS just because you are a .NET guy and YAGNI
      (You Aint Gonna Need It) to actual CMS programming, get a proper CMS (the best
      ones are in PHP), and that might just be WordPress.

    message: Orchard is good and has built-in workflow, but the lack of documentation
      and contributions is one of its cons. You can find many outdated plugins and
      all developers request another developer to update the plugin, and this is an
      issue in .NET community.
