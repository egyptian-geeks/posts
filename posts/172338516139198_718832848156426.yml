  High-Level Competition (Kaggle) - Awesome prizes & more...!

  During my master thesis, i was discovering deep learning (DL) concept and found out that Geoffrey Hinton (ML pioneer) is a professor at University of Toronto and also researcher at Google due to its distinguished work on DL, he always talks about how his PhD students can easily win kaggle competitions using DL

  let's try going dirty and find out how real problems solve!!

    message: 'I totally agree with you. There are many impressive results using deep
      learning in many kaggle competitions (examples: http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/02/deep-learning-wins-dogs-vs-cats-competition.html
      and http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/31/merck-competition-results-deep-nn-and-gpus-come-out-to-play/
      ). I also recommend checking prof. Hinton''s course on Coursera (Neural Networks
      for Machine Learning https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets). It was offered
      only once back in 2012. But the course materials are still open and anyone can
      learn on his own.'
