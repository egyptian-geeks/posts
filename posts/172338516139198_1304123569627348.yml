  SA Guys,

  I would like to know which company would you suggest to get hosting and domain name. It's for a blog not something big.

      If it's gonna be a static site (just plain HTML, CSS, JS files) then I would recommend GitHub Pages (Free) and get a domain name from GoDaddy for example or whatever

      If your blog will not be a static one (CMS) then it really depends on your experience with setting up things on servers or on how much you want to be involved

      I would recommend having a VPS from DigitalOcean for 5 USD or an even cheaper good option Time4VPS.eu (1 EUR)

      Or if it's gonna be a Wordpress one then you could go with Wordpress hosting or any cheap shared hosting company like FatCow for example

      Separate the domain company from the hosting
      so godaddy for the domain and ..... for the hosting
