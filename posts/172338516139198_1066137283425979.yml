    message: I also recommend this course. I've watched in couple months ago it's
      really great for those who want to know what's going on behind the scenes and
      how can you develop a very powerful software just by knowing what's exactly
      happens since the request hits your server till the end of the response. It's
      not recommended for those who adores copy paste and they want a quick ramp up
      to a technology to add it to their CV with the minimum or none information about
      it.
