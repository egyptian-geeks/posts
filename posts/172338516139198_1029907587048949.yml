  Dears,
  Anyone tried crossover.com ? Are they trustworthy ?
  For anyone who doesn't know them they're having remote working opportunities
  You get hired after successfully complete a series of tests and interviews
  And then they outsource you to third party clients
  They have their tracking software as well which take screenshots from your screen and take photos from your webcam as well while you're working
  If you have an experience with them it would be great if you can share it with us.
  Thanks.

      I think I've seen their job posts under several different names (like DevFactory) years ago.
      From the answers in the below thread, you probably better not to apply for such hectic company.

      Yes I've seen this, but I also heard that they're for real
      So I thought I might get personal opinions as well
      But changing company name so many times doesn't seem right

      it pays well and it's relatively stable, they are having a lot of structure changes in the past  2 years or so, but if you're working well, even if the team you're in shuts down, they move you to another team.
      In my opinion it's good, but not a long term position, however this depends on your ambitions and goals.
