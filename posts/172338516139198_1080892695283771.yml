message: "انا عندى مشكلة ديما مع ال js انا لقيتنى يحتاجها كتير فاتعلمت الاساسيات بها
  قعدت مدة بستخدم ال jquery و بعدين ذاكرت ال anjularjs واشتغلت بيه فترة. مشكلتى الرءيسية
  انى مش عارف ابقى احسن js ازاى. انا معقول فيها بس فى اكواد كتيييير عل github بحاول
  افهم source code بتاعها بس مبعرفش لانه متطور جدا بالنسبالى. و بالتالى اما بتقابلنى
  مشكلة ما بحاول الجء لاى حاجة غير ال js. \nسؤالى هنا. ازاى احسن نفسى فى الjs عشان
  افهم اكواد الناس الى فال github. هل فى اسلوب او approach معين فى الدراسة ليها انتوا
  بتستخدموه ؟\n و ياريت لو تذكرو الاماكن الى درستوه منها لانى تايه اوى بالنسبة لل
  js. الكورسات كتييير و الفيديوهات اكتر و كذلك الكتب مش عارف ابدء بايه و اعمل ايه
  بالظبط..."

      Try JS patterns like module pattern, iffe.
      what is prototypes and how to use it to simulate inheritance.
      How to create jquery plugin or extension.
      closure in JS.
      How JS get compiled in browsers. (browsers Compile js not interpreting)
      Try to work more with functions and how to use it as a variable :)
      there is nothing else in my mind right now but JS is easy but you need to get the core of it

      Try to understand closures and prototype inheritance,  falsey and truthy comparisons with null, undefined, arrays, etc, and understand the two phases of DOM events, and of course event propagation, how "this"/" new"/scope work, what's strict mode, and you'll be good.

      Each topic had a lot of good stuff written about online.

      I had the same problems for several years. Sometimes libraries do extreme optimization based on a lot of research in certain areas not based only on the general knowledge of the authors.

      Sometimes also library authors love clever code over readable code. That's very common.

      I always felt bad reading what i learned later was just unnecessarily clever code until i started becoming THE Css and Js guy in many engagements i went to at several clients with big and small teams. I stopped bothering afterwards.

      I would advice you to do the same. Aim to learn JS in and out, but ignore the Github metric.

      The free ES6 online book is awesome. JS the good parts is a classic. Some other good books are things like the JavaScript Applications book. Those would be good places. I'd go to for the ES6 book.

      The entire blog is worth reading as well, every single post.

    message: Functional programming concepts with a language like Haskell would really
      help, if you ask me why learn another language to be good at JS, it is because
      through learning Haskell you will understand the concepts behind functional
      programming, in a purely functional language, then things like Reactive JS will
      not seem so foreign to you. In the end, JS manipulates markup and sends requests,
      with something like Node you get to do some back end, but my bet is soon there
      will also be other languages/ accents that compete, so being capable in multiple
      languages/dialects is good for you.
