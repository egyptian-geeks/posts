    message: "Good post but here are a couple of points regarding the article which
      I assume was geared towards people who want to start learning about front-end.\n\nGeneral
      feedback:\n\n- As a general rule, you always need to learn the basics of any
      language. \n- You don't need to learn any frameworks, until it solves an issue
      you are facing. So your advice to learn to \"master\" React, Angular or Angular2
      is a bit off (same applies to CSS preprocessors & HTML preprocessors)\n- DON'T
      learn CoffeeScript, AMD, Grunt, underscore or Bower. All are dead. And HTML
      preprocessors are useless, you can pick it up in a couple of hours when needed.\n-
      w3schools is NOT a trusted references, MDN is great & enough.\n- Read many blogs
      not just only CSS-tricks.\n\nFor JavaScript:\n\n- You just need to learn JavaScript,
      no need to complicate things with TypeScript & stuff.\n- When you feel the need
      for a module system use ES modules. If you deal with node then use CJS & understand
      that both are not exacty the same.\n\nFor CSS:\n\n- Best CSS is vanilla CSS,
      no need for preprocessors. If you want imports & stuff look into PostCSS. But
      in general preprocessors is not a must have skill.\n- Don't learn Bootstrap
      or Material design or grids that comes with them, build your own & learn from
      that. They are bloated & will never be used in production for a serious product.
      \n- Learn about SVG instead of font-icons, which are bad for accessibility &
      not as flexible as SVG.\n\nFor HTML:\n\n- HTML is more powerful sometimes than
      what most people think it is, deeply understand tags, attributes & what you
      can do with them without CSS & JS.\n\n----\n\nWhen I do hire people for my team
      I only look for deep understanding of the stack (HTML, CSS & JS) most of the
      time I don't care about what tools or things they use. I look for the knowledge,
      frameworks comes & goes but knowledge is staying & it will enable you learn
      any framework or lib.\n\nLearn the basics, not the specifics. the rest is easy.
      And only learn things that solves your problems not because others are using
      it."
