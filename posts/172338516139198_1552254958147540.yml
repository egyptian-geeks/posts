message: "I have several questions about scalability in web development. \n\n1) scalability
  depends on what exactly ? Does it depend on the language, like do we say javascript
  is more scalable than php ? Or the framework like laravel is more scalable than
  nodejs or does it depend on the whole stack like LAMP is more scalable that MEAN
  stack ?\n\n2) how do we measure scalability exactly?\n\n3) I heard same people say
  that laravel is more scalable than MEAN stack, but I never understood why and I
  googled a lot but most people say that they both do the same job and there is no
  difference, so is there any evidence that a certain technology is more scalable
  than the other ?\n\nAny help would be really appreciated and Thanks in advance."

      I think scalability is related to application operation not related to programming language itself, I can scale .Net application same way I scale Node.js application.
      scalable application mean; application that can absorb or handle any load of traffic.

    message: "Scalability in general in the web means that you should be able to handle
      X amount of traffic aka Capacity with Y resources, and when the traffic increases
      you should be able to add more resources to increase you capacity. \nThe problem
      is, sometimes due to a lot of problems that relationship between X & Y may not
      be linear, it often happens that no matter how much Y you increase the amount
      of capacity you add is very minimal, and that usually happens when you have
      some system bottleneck, somewhere in your system design or code or infrastructure
      prevents the system from scaling or making scaling way more expensive than it
      should be. \nThese reasons can be pretty much anything, maybe your code is not
      optimized, you user very slow algorithms that require a lot of resources so
      you need to optimize it, or maybe your database connections are running out
      so all your web traffic has to be queued up for long time to get their turns,
      maybe your network is saturated so you can't push more bits out/in the machines
      so no matter what you do you can't scale unless you upgrade your network or
      optimize your use of the network, maybe your disks are very slow and you need
      to read and write alot so it increases your making your whole system slow ...
      etc\nTo even start working on this you need to setup some KPIs (Key Performance
      Indicators) which are the important metrics you care about, for example you
      want your homepage latency to be less than 300ms, and your throughout to be
      at least 1000 req/sec and your availability to be 99.9% Weekly. \nYou set up
      your monitoring systems to keep an eye on these metrics."

      Scalability is an Architecture topic and is not related to programming language. There are two types of scalability.
      1- Vertical scalability : what Mohamed Elsherif elaborated above.(network/infrastructure related)
      2- Horizontal Scalability : pretty much like distributed systems where you can add more connected nodes to handle the load. Think about Microservices.
      Achieving Horizontal Scaling requires a lot of upfront thinking and it is much more than just choosing a programming language.

    message: "So, there are two distinct things in here:\n1- Efficiency/Perf: This
      has several ways to define it, but generally in web is how many requests/sec
      can be served by a single machines. Some web server implementations  are more
      efficient than the others, but it doesn't end there, in general, there are so
      many things that affect your overall throughput, this includes the latency of
      your application code (usually is where the majority of the time is spent),
      disk IO, remote operations (distributed systems, or talking to a remote database,
      etc.). Some confuse this with the \"vertical scalability\" definition which
      is different. Vertical scalability means that you can increase your key metric
      (say requests/sec or Mb/s) by upping your hardware, a faster CPU, more main
      memory, etc. So, when someone says \"Vertically Scalable\" he means that the
      application can serve more traffic linearly if we can get better hardware. This
      is not true in all programs, at least not in a linear fashion. You don't get
      twice the requests/sec if you get a CPU that is twice as fast. \n2- Scalability:
      This is a system architecture property, and usually used to refer to \"Horizontal
      Scalability\" which means that we can (almost linearly) increase the overall
      capacity of the system by adding more machines to a running cluster. Surprisingly,
      in most cases, scalable systems are \"slower\" if you compare the sheer performance
      of a system that is designed to run on a single box vs. a distributed system
      that does several round-trip requests across the network. So, it's less efficient
      but scalable."
