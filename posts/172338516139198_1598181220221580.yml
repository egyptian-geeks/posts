message: "How to publish React project to NPM? \n\nHello, I created a React project
  to be used as a library using create-react-app\nNow I published the project to NPM
  but I just discovered that I didn't convert ES6 and JSX to normal JS. How do I do
  this?\n\nI followed a number of guides found online but some didn't work or was
  outdated.\nThis was one of them:\n\nhttps://www.chadly.net/publishing-react-to-npm/"

    message: "You have to specify your library entry point (main) in package.json.
      So, basically, you need all your source files (ES6/7 + JSX) compiled to ES5
      using your module bundler (webpack/browserify) and then specify your compiled
      file path as your library entry point. \n\n{\n  \"main\": \"/path/to/your/compiled/library.js\"\n}"
