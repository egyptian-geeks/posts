  Hello fellow geeks. I'm having trouble connecting to the company's VPN in the US since about Sunday. The connection is PPTP, I was wondering if anyone is having the same issue. I have tried:
  - 2 different Windows 10 machines
  - Ubuntu Linux
  - Switching connections (TEData ADSL with static IP, Vodafone 3G USB Modem).

  Any suggestions, or anyone else facing this same issue?

  Note: I can telnet form my machine to the designated IP on the PPTP port (1723)
