    message: "I watched this post getting updated 3 times so far. Second update added
      VB and the third added Ruby, which tells me one of two things if not both: \n\na)
      You haven't done much research on your end before you posted\nb) You have little
      to no idea about what you're asking about\n\nSo which is it? Also while you're
      at it, could you explain what do you mean by building applications visually?\n\nDo
      you mean code builds (Ruby doesn't exactly have that notion) or do you mean
      constructing applications using visual tools like GUI builder and the like,
      or are you just looking for a point & click software that abstracts you away
      from the terminal.\n\nA quick google search for VS alternatives can yield a
      lot of fruitful results and since I presume you're already familiar with VS
      being an IDE, a little google search for Ruby IDE will yet again, yield a lot
      of fruitful results.\n\nGood luck."

    message: I edit post because no one answer me, so i became more specific ... ,
      Visual developing means mainly building GUI rather than playing with code and
      getting the debugger reports , with visual developing tools coder can play with
      codes and link them to standard shell elements ... But what i really ask is
      there a decent visual builder for languages like Ruby or Scala. Definitely i
      searched but not satisfied with results so i called for help.

    message: Also i try to understand why high end languages, such as ruby or perl
      or python ...etc doesn't have visual editors (i mean good one like visual studio
      for vb and c++, netbeans for java)
