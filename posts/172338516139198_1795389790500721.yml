  Good evening, I have several questions about (Cyber security) field. I'm a 4 years developer (web/Android) and was wondering about that field.

  I've searched there and there, didn't find a unified information that I can relay on, so here's what I need to know.

  1. Are certifications important in this field, does have a certification or not decides whether I get accepted in a company or not ?

  2. I'm not Engineering nor computer science graduate, would It matter when applying to that role ?

  3. Where's the best place to start, either by self studying, or by taking a course (please mention a place if so).

  I have many other questions, but I think I'll find an answer with a simple search.

  Thank you.
