  Good evening, I have several questions about (Cyber security) field. I'm a 4 years developer (web/Android) and was wondering about that field.

  I've searched there and there, didn't find a unified information that I can relay on, so here's what I need to know.

  1. Are certifications important in this field, does have a certification or not decides whether I get accepted in a company or not ?

  2. I'm not Engineering nor computer science graduate, would It matter when applying to that role ?

  3. Where's the best place to start, either by self studying, or by taking a course (please mention a place if so).

  I have many other questions, but I think I'll find an answer with a simple search.

  Thank you.

    message: I think the easiest way for you to start since you are already familiar
      with Android dev is to lookup some tutorials on APK reverse engineering and
      android malware. There are many tutorials online. Certification is not necessary
      at all not even a computer science education (though it helps). Setup a simple
      blog + github and start posting your analysis/code. That is what matters. If
      you prefer formal education I believe there are courses on coursera.

      هو انا شايفة أن معظم الاجابات لاسئلتك هتبدأ ب it depends.
      ١. على المكان اللي هتشتغل فيه.
      ٢. على قدرتك على تعليم نفسك لوحدك ..
