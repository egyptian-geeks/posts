  I guess that this is the best place to put my question in as most of us -as a developers - are workaholic persons, what do you do in your day/life which  makes you  energetic/happy to continue on in your daily days task ?
  what things you do which just makes you satisfied and energetic to continue your life accomplishing your plans ?

    message: "Don't burn yourself out, I found after a while that when you don't put
      fixed work hours you end up spending more time at work but doing almost the
      same work anyway, you end up waking up late, arriving at work late, hardly doing
      anything productive in the morning, staying up late at work, rinse and repeat.
      \nIf you know you have to leave by hour X, you week prioritize better, you won't
      wake up late and you will leave early enough to do something else in your life"

      - Using sticky notes to always remember you.
      - Chellenging yourself.
      - Find some one who chellenge you to keep on.
      - Talking about your dreams or passion to some one else is enough to motivate you by listening to their opinion like what Mohamed Mostafa and better if that one told you that you can't do it ;)
