    message: I don't think so. Prepare them just in case but your resume should fit
      in one page and showcase your skills through experience, Projects and education

      It's ok to add them. Not mentioned explicitly but it's there in the template.

      No
      Listing the course curriculum of your school is not useful, distracting and a waste of time. Focus on areas/courses/projects that you believe are your strengths and passion
