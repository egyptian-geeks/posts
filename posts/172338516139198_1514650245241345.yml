  Algorithms and data structures are very important topics, not for interviews, but only for a lot of topics regarding embedded systems and game development. For example in an embedded system like a telephone set, you would want to look for a name, if the names are in terms of millions, you would perform a linear time searching algorithms, which is very slow considering a uC which works with 10MHz frequency.What about receiving alot of bytes using you UART, how would you store them ? what if you miss some bytes, and you want to continue working with them when the connection is broken ? Have you heared of ring buffers? Queues ?.
  The same story applies in game development, for example consider writing a large Finite state machine FSM for AI, are you going to write a large set of if else,.etc, how about descission trees ? suppose you are familiar with algorithms, how about finding paths for your AI agent using A* ? Considering you're familiar with tree data structure, and you have a large outdoor scene, which has million of objects, do you want the camera to render all those objects ? How about occlusion the objects that are out of your view ? Octree, KD-tree comes to rescue..
