      ^I don't like this kind of software..I like to write code..I don't want a software to write it for me.
      I meant designing a "mockup" of the site (just a static image) on Photoshop before starting to code..I think it might make the coding process smoother but it will consume a lot of time too!
      So I'm asking whether professionals do this.

      to convert my prototype to digital and then I use sketch but PhotoShop will
      be okay if you are on windows

    message: I use Sketch too, you can use Adobe Fireworks -- if not for assets just
      mockups --  a pen and paper could be your best option.
