    message: 'Even though I wouldn''t use it (because Trello #AllTheThings), but I
      still love this approach.  Very nice way of maintaining tasks by hand (except
      you don''t to), and I also love that ticks are saved in preview mode in Github
      Markdown.'

    message: Folks, I tried trello for a while, but you've got to try Wunderlist for
      more simple stuff (tasks with only two states, say just to-do and done). It
      also have nice Android App

    message: Trello scales up and down very well for me. The simplest thing is just-title
      cards moving between 2 lists, all the way to working with team, checklists,  and
      labeling and getting notifications and all the complex stuff...

    message: I also use the Android app for my personal board (I call it Personal
      Kanban, so that I feel smart and organised :D). Historically it wasn't the best
      ever but it has evolved a lot in recent months.
