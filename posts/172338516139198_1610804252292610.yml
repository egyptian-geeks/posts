    message: |-
      In C++ a struct member variable has public access modifier by default and you do not need to specify it though
      Furthermore in C++ a struct is cooler since you can specify all functions of that struct inside the struct itself, so you keep things grouped and clean.

    message: If you deal with large code base where recompilation matters. I have
      just learnd about the PImpl design pattern in C++, which could be used to remove
      the dependency between implementation details and the base class.

    message: I guess one more reason you need to compile all source code with the
      same compiler once changes have been made is the C++ name mangling which is
      not consistent among different compilers and for this you could use extern C
      as well for some cases where you don't want C++ to mangle the function names
      but you have to ensure no overloads for these functions of course. This may
      reduce your need to recompile your source code as well but I am not sure if
      this would make a difference anyway.
