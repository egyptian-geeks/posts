  Showing off a little bit :)

  This is my #Debian net install after I ran #Jesbang script and installed #openbox and Conky. I also have #Pycharm and #Emacs installed and about to install #Eclipse all from code and compiled (except Pycharm)

  Notice the Conky declares only 75 MB RAM use after 3 days of rrunning straight, opening Iceweasel browser, Pycharm and closing again.

  Please also share with me your development or Custom envirornment.
