  Folks, at an embassy, and for one to get a visa as fast as possible, should he ask for a visitor visa, or another visa type for an interview there? What to expect/ask from/to a sponsorship recruiter in this process?

  Your help is highly appreciated.

  PS: this is for a UK visa

    message: "For the UK visa, which is not a Schengen, or Europe visa, you should
      ask your recruiter for an invitation letter. The letter should state clearly
      who is paying for the trip.\n\nThen you will need to book an appointment at
      TLS Contact visa application centre. You will be applying for a short stay business

      Uk visit visa 6 months is easy to get and is ok for interview, just ask them for a letter of invitation for business meeting. And get a flight and hotel reservation (not paid).
      You can get that online.
