message: Hey guys. Non-technical question but again think it's the best place to get
  an answer. People who work in Europe, how did you handle the whole first name/last
  name thing in general? Do you just use your first name and last name (4th name?)
  in the passport respectively? In the German national visa application form for example,
  it asks for the family name, and for the "name" it says "Vorname(n)" and for that
  I'm wondering if I should only write my first name or does the (n) imply that I
  need to write my 2nd and 3rd name too in that field (up to but not including the
  last (4th) name? Sorry for the odd question but this is confusing.

      as a legal advice. \n\nIf you are asked for your last name, write the family
      name as shown in passport. That's the last one in your full name in passport.
      \n\nIf you are asked for your first name, or your \"given name\", enter just
      your name as shown in your passport, *not* your father's name etc\n\nIf you
      are asked for middle name or middle names, enter all the names between your
      first name and last name as explained above.  Always as on passport of course.
      \n\nIf you are asked for your first names or your given name(s) - with an \"s\"
      at the end, whether in brackets or not , and there is no field for middle name(s),
      then enter your first name followed by your middle names"

    message: Vorname(s) is the given names, usually in official documents you write
      everything up until your last name as shown in the passport. In some documents
      in that field they also ask you to underline the call name, and that is your
      first name.

    message: "From my experience in France. \n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT rule is: the style
      you choose in your visa/residency card has to be the one you stick to in every
      single paper you fill later, otherwise, you will be considered a different person.
      \n\n2nd rule is, unless explicitly told it's not important (like in my bank),
      you SHOULD NOT take off the 2nd and 3rd name. You will be told your name should
      mirror your passport. So all four names should be on the paper you're filling\n\nI
      chose to not use the middle name field as it means something different in the
      US. And chose the first name to be Rami.\n\nGood luck"

      For the Visa, first names = first 3, last name = 4th.
      When I arrived in Germany, I explained that two middle names are father/grandfather and got my residence permit with firstname lastname on it. After I moved, the new foreigner's office told me, that the previous one is mistaken and it must be the same name as in the passport all in one line (So now I am sorted into A not F).

    message: Without a lot of discussions an opinions .. as the previous comment your
      passport has a division that you should follow.. at the machine readable part
      you will find your name each name with < and the last name has << before it
      .. usually it is the first 3 are first and the the last one is last ... In less
      official documents you may use your name as first and the last one as last ..
