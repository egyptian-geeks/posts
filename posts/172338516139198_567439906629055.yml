    message: "What is exactly your problem ? \n1. You can find tutorials here at their
      website. http://www.nme.io/developer/tutorials/\n2. You need to know the basics
      of Game Programming, so try to read any textbook that talks about game loops,
      finite state machines, basic AI..etc. \n3. The library itself will just give
      you ways to load graphics, get key handlers, play sound,..etc. You then need
      to load sprite animations, write some physics using another library like Box2D."

    message: good my problem is the website of nme itself, they don't have a documentation
      and i found it hard to start, instead of the documentation i am searching for
      good tutorials and the tutorials on their site are so weak :/

    message: You do not need any other tutorials to start with. They have all the
      information in their website to write a full game. First try to load a bitmap,
      then read their tutorials about key handlers, play sound. From that point you
      can write a Pong game so easily. Just add some basic vector reflections and
      that's all.  You need to extend their library for having more advanced concepts
      like Particle Systems,..etc.

    message: "You need to read few chapters from\nTricks of Windows Game Programming
      Gurus, Andre' LaMothe, Stay away from the chapters on windows programming, DirectX,
      They are outdated. I was mentored by the Author for years till now, and it's
      really a great book. \nThere are a lot of books that talk about Android Game
      Programming, iOS,..etc. Try also to read them, just get the basic concepts like
      I said above."
