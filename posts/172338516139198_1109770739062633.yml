message: "What about Egyptian-Geeks-Weekly :-D ?! \nA website that spreads the knowledge
  and experience of this group's experts in their fields. I know that members will
  have limited time to write posts for this project, but it would be easy if we had
  more experts to contribute.\nWhat about having departments for technologies; languages,
  front-end, back-end, big data, machine learning, Software design, security, best
  practices, etc. \nI think it will make a difference and improve developers' quality.
  \nDoes this idea worth consideration or \"kollo fel keltsh\" :-D ??"

      I like the idea. Even if it's too hard to have it as a "weekly" we can make it Bi-weekly.
      Also, as a motivation for the writers, they can write the posts in their blogs and the weekly then becomes a list of links from different blogs. It's then a win win, for the writers and readers.

    message: How will you generate money? answering this question is a validation
      for the idea, otherwise, it will die, I like Eslam's idea about using existing
      websites or blogs, this can be a start to validate people's interest in such
      thing as you don't need only writers.
