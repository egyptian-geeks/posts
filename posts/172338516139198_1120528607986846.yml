  I asked this question few days ago and got two answers both not working for me.
  After days of searching, i got some results and wanna share it with u.
  https://github.com/HangfireIO  is a perfect solution for a set of reasons.
  - Saving the scheduled tasks in the database.
  - availability to cancel re-schedule a task.
  - provide a dashboard to know the status of each task.
   and others...
  scott hanselman has a blog post about other options if u are  interested,  http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRunBackgroundTasksInASPNET.aspx
