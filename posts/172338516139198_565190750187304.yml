    message: Moutaz, thank you. I maily focus on the classic git tools, GitExtensions
      and of course the Console. I don't use the visual Studio support for anything
      serious (maybe when libgit2 adds rebase support), nor even Github for Windows.
      Not to mention Git is quite opinionated, and I'm trying to avoid contraversal
      topics at this stage.

    message: Have you thought about making videos in Arabic? I know that 99% of the
      content is in English, but that's the problem

      The main reason that got me into trying out the process after years of not taking action was some internal recordings we started in Readify. That's why my mind was more into the English speaking audience (making sure it's simple enough for non-natives like Egyptians).
      There is some localization-related idea though that will be nice in Arabic. Considering it now.
