      Just an advice, proper English will help you be taken seriously. This includes, among others, proper capitalization, no excess amount of smilies, correct punctuation and no 'ur'.

      I say this because I wrote like this too when I was 14 and only when someone brought it to my attention, I realized how stupid I looked.
