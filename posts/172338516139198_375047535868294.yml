    message: "So why is it shaking the IE Empire and close to become number 1, if
      any thing annoying with chrome that will be the continuous updating, which make
      most of plug-ins look retarded, \nAlso think about their revolutionary products
      like chrome os, google apps, goggles, gmail, ... believe me GOOGLE owns the
      INTERNET"
