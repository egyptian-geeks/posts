message: "What is the best track for learning computer vision for real time apps?
  \n1- learn basic of image processing like matlab then learn openCV\n2-learning openCV
  directly \n3-learning basic of AI and ML first \n********\nIt is good idea to start
  with EMGU in c# ( liberery to wrapper openCV in .NET) \nOr start with python then
  movement to EMGU"

      Digital Imaging processing Gonzales,
      Learning Opencv book
      Basics of AI can be studied using any Game AI programming book

    message: "If you want to let the computer make his own decisions by thinking and
      seeing , \nThen i think just focus on AI and ML.\n image processing and such
      techniques was for straight forward mehods for solving certain problems \n\nSo
      my opinion\nGo first with understanding ML algorithms and how it can be applied
      with game engines.\nThen use any library for image processing with simple tutorials
      with it will be enough to use its outputs and numbers as inputs to your ML setup
      inputs.\n\nSummery\n- study ml algorithms \n- learn applications of ml in game
      engines (unity and unreal have these features now)\n- watch sample tutorials
      of open cv or emgu for your project purposes only\n- start making your own setup
      of combining those ( don't forget to check if there is similar setup done already
      for same purpose of your project before to study it. )"
