  PSA: as someone who reviews a LOT of CVs for my company, I urge you:

  DO NOT list competency in C and C++ as

  C/C++: whatever

  Listing them both as interchangeable immediately tells anyone with any competency that you suck at one or the other, or more commonly both. They are not a "variation" on the language and you shouldn't treat them as such. I'm posting this here because I see it a lot more commonly from Egyptian CVs :/

  On a side note, I once saw C/C++/C# on a CV and... Just... No. Just, don't. Please.

      I know these are totally different languages with different idioms, but 80%
      of projects that are related to low level stuff are C/C++ because there is a
      ton of C legacy code that is just used as is with a C++ compiler, because C++
      has some nice safety and code ruse features for new code, yet no one wants to
      rewrite old C code in idiomatic C++, and it wouldn't make sense to just call
      it C++ because some part is full of unsafe pointer gymnastics, void* and malloc,
      \nso in my opinion it makes sense to list C/C++ as a skill, and as a job requirement
      because managing such projects is different than pure C  or C++"

      It is totally fine to write it that way.
      By this argument one must say proficiency in each c++ standard ?

      What really should be considered is not writing c++ with c style.
