  Hello guys,,
  I'm have so frustrating issue while using ray-cast and collider.
  Instead of returning the game object name it returns "collision"...

  Debug.Log("Name: " + rcHitInfo.collider.name + " ... " + rcHitInfo.point);

  Even with using event trigger it returns "collision"
  Any ideas ?

      Collider is a component attached to the GameObject, so you can say rcHitInfo.collider.gameObject.name
      But I would highly suggest staying away form game object names because it leads to messy code (and instantiated prefabs have numbered names), use Tags or Layers instead.
      Why exactly do you need the game object's name?

      Yeah using Layers when doing raycasts is probably the most efficient and optimized thing, because you only get hits on the things you care about.
      BTW if you have a lot of nested objects (model split into pieces w keda), try putting the collider component on the topmost object instead of on the model pieces or on the redundant inner objects.

      My personal advice is to avoid using the camera controllers from the Assets, they're way too complicated for most use-cases, it would be better to write your own and implement just the parts you want.
      Regarding changing the direction of where W goes, there are two ways:
      - on the game object that represents the head rotation, do something like:
      transform.Translate(transform.forward * speed); // or just hardcode the speed
      - on any other game object, take a reference to the transform component on the head rotation game object and do something like:
      transform.Translate(headTrans.forward * speed);

      basically "forward" is a unit vector that tell you the direction of that transform, so multiplying by the speed gives you the velocity with the correct direction.
      there is also transform.right for handling horizontal movement :)
