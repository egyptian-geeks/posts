  Does anybody know companies here in Cairo which has products built upon a good model of Microservices architecture and are concerned with event buses, docker, build and deployment automation, Cloud-Based (AWS or GCP), unit and automated integration tests, multi tenancy?

  Please if you know any state company names, product/business domain and technology stack they use.

  Thanks in advance
