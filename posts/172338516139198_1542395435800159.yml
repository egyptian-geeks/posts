    message: "It is possible to use only angular+JS+Html+css. However, I recommend
      using one of many websocket client side libraries. Websockets is a protocol
      that makes bi-directional communications much faster and easier. \n\nReady made
      libraries can handle complicated stuff like automatically reconnecting when
      connection is lost, detecting browser capabilities and using other mechanics
      such as long polling if browser doesn't support websockets, etc.\n\nYour choice
      of library would probably depend on what server side technology you use since
      many like sockets.io and SignalR come with both server side and client side
      components that work together.\n\nCheck this page:\nhttps://deepstream.io/blog/realtime-framework-overview/"
