    message: What do you mean by memory leak, does the worker you have creates  orphan
      processes lying around ?, usually worker threads consume the a core or more
      depending on your setting , if you just see a memory spike every 5 min that's
      normal but if the memory continue to build up you can use supervisor to manage
      your worker jobs and handle the queues more effective and efficiently
