message: "Did anyone tried before to create a custom Android keyboard for a some use
  case in certain activity in his app. I need to make it extend the keyboard class
  and the keyboard view class so i can make it complete native keyboard. So i can
  make use of the keyboard functionality in android with a different look. \nAm i
  thinking right or should i just create it as a part of the layout with the regular
  layout components.\nI did some work with making a native custom keyboard and i changed
  the look but i could not get it to work when some edittext has focus. The user still
  have to go and choose it from settings inputmethod. I need to be able programmatically
  to make my keyboard the default input method. \nI just want to know what is the
  best way to do this build a custom keyboard or just make it in the layout."
