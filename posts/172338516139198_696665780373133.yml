      for fast installation i prefer to use the WinRar SFX archive it have most of the options you need for the installation like creating shortcuts,choose the installation path,logo,silent install,etc... but you files could be extracted without installation if the user has noticed that.

      a Tip for running html application as iframe in Windows , try to change the extension of the index file of the application to ".hta" -> "HTML Application" this will open the website on separated frame as if you open a normal application , instead of creating a C# app as container to view your website.

      Ala Frg I'd hate to burst your bubble but the proposed solution is a tad far from the OP's problem. It's also far from being user friendly, certainly breaks out of the expected UX for a windows consumer.
      Also, albeit I'm no fan of Air or just about anything developer related from Adobe* but by all means, AS and the Air runtime are amongst some of the most well documented platforms I've stumbled upon. However, in all fairness, Adobe's developer resources is just sincerely painful and their IA is badly designed.

      Specially if you are building plugins for say, Photoshop or any other of their tools. Also, there seems to be a very blurred line between "Free" and "Paid" in Adobe developer tools, almost always you'll find yourself about to pay if you aren't too careful or if you didn't dig hard enough for an alternative.

    message: "Ala Frg I believe you didn't grasp my comment well enough. \nI said
      \"your solution is far from the OP's problem\"\nAnd I said \"I'm no fan of Air\".\n\nYou
      also clearly missed out on a critical requirement mentioned by the OP, it has
      to be packaged as an executable file. And it's not about opening up a webpage
      in a browser, you can write do this in C and get done with it.\nIt's about embedding
      the iFrame, the OP wants an executable that checks for connectivity, finds it
      then loads an iFrame within the application's window. If not then it'll display
      a message.\nSo how do you propose embedding an iFrame with a shell script?\n\nLastly,
      good for you for migrating from Air. But please stay objective when you present
      a counter argument to a platform and state hard evidence to your claims. \"Platform
      is very stupid\", \"Security issues\" and \"Lack of documentation\" simply doesn't
      cut it through. A platform is only as good as for what it's intended to be used
      for.\n\nIf you try to build a web app in assembly, you certainly can but that'd
      be stupid, painful, very likely exploitable and certainly for that task, documentation
      would be lacking. That doesn't mean that assembly with it's various assemblers
      aren't well documented.\n\nLike I said, I'm no fan of Air but I'm also no fan
      of unfair technical assessments."

    message: "Yes but most of the windows users has .NET framework pre-installed or
      at least the basics to run an non-fancy exe file without the need to tell the
      user you need to install this app. the Tidesdk looks awesome as the only functionality
      of the app will be to open a website. nothing more and nothing less. I tried
      the xamarin studio but it seems complicated for such a simple task!  i was hoping
      to find something like: http://fluidapp.com/ for windows but apparently it's
      too simple to exist! and I think this can be a very cool app if anyone would
      do it and sell it on the windows app store. \n\nA fuckin simple app you drag
      and drop the icon tell it which website you want to load when the user execute
      it and nothing more. \n\nLet me know if anyone is interested I don't mind investing
      part of my time for this type of apps.\n\nBest Regards,"

      شوف ده كدا exe مش بيطلب dependencies غير الدوت نت 2 يعني يشتغل على أغلب الويندوزات وحجمه أقل من ميجا، المشكلة يمكن اللي فيه هي إنه غالبا هيعرض الموقع بـ IE engine اصدار 6 أو 7 أو كدا

      لو حلو معاك قل لي على أي تعديلات أعملهالك لو لسه مش فاكر تتعامل مع الدوت نت
