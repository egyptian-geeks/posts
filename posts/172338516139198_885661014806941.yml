message: "Help needed! \n\nOn iOS or Android is there a way to create push notifications
  that have a custom view (i.e. custom actions like Download Update, Confirm...etc.)
  And i need to push these notification to users on certain times they can be local
  notifications or pushed from internet the important thing is that i can get the
  custom view even if the app is closed.\n\nAny idea how?"

    message: "I need to show a notification to the user but not the standard push
      notification you get, i need to provide couple of actions on the notification
      view itself. let's say a download button and cancel button. \n\nI can do this
      with in-app notifications but that require the app to be working on the background.
      I need to be able to show these custom views notifications while the app is
      closed if that possible.\n\nI am not sure if its possible yet, but i've seen
      Facebook notifications with LIKE button."

      This can be done in Apache Cordova, check the below
      http://devgirl.org/2013/07/17/tutorial-implement-push-notifications-in-your-phonegap-application/

      If you get the notification while your app is closed, tapping the notification will open your app and show whatever custom view you implemented.

      Android 4+. In this kind of notifications, you can send a direct action to the
