  guys i've an idea about a new activity in our group.

  after this post https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/734993243207053/

  i liked that debate between us. so why don't we have something like debates. for example PHP vs Ruby. and get the experts from both side to start the debate. i'll help the group members enhancing their skills. whta do you think guys?!

      in "php vs ruby", then we have a problem, and we don't attract the crowd we
      think we want.

    message: Ask Developer hangouts might be a more suitable place for this. The hangouts
      have a wider audience that includes beginners (unlike this group), who may benefit
      from knowing how PHP and Ruby are different in the first place.

      I used to jump on these cage matches, but it turns out that programming language selection is not always objective. Something like significant white space in Python is considered a disadvantage, while most pythonistas consider it a good thing.

      On the other hands, I believe it will be healthier if we compare programming languages as "different", not better or worse. They can work together, even if they are very similar like Ruby & Python. As an example, pygments is a popular syntax highlighter which has wrappers in many different languages, although it's written in Python.

    message: Mohammad Tayseer you're right. i mean doing debates between for example
      two different technologies or schools. like i was just asking "notifications
      via ajax or via sockets". or may be debates about enhancing and optimizing your
      development stack. you can let the group members choose the two sides and have
      a vote about on debate, then start a hangout about it.

    message: These things come as people need / ask them. I think bringing them up
      for the sake of bringing them up will not be inspiring enough to make good ones.
      Just bring them on whenever you have a real question in your head :)
