    message: The case in the Node world is much better than it in the Ruby world for
      example. It didn't start this way, but Microsoft approached Node core for adding
      APIs to some things that package and module developers used to ask from OS directly.
      Once the APIs were in Node, it became a best practice to use them instead of
      talking to OS directly.

    message: That's why, when someone who cares forks Yeoman or Grunt or whatever
      other big project and adds Windows support, although the project owners often
      don't care much, they often accept the pull request. Windows support has gone
      from not-very-miserable  when I first looked to not-bad-at-all by early-mid
      2013.
