message: "Hiii, I have been digging lately for software engineer salaries and software
  hourly rates. \nI can easily get the statistics of salaries and rates for different
  programming languages and platforms worldwide but, What about Egypt ?\n\nFor a free
  lancer developer (back-end, web, mobile or software in general) how much should
  he charge for a development hour in Egypt?\nIs it the same as freelance websites
  (ex. upwork, Freelancer or toptal) ?\n\nIn a discussion with a software engineer
  he told me that pricing should be as follows:\nA fresh software engineer gets about
  4500 LE as a start(as far as I can remember that was a year ago )\ndivided by 160
  hours per month (4 weeks x 5 days x 8 hours)\nresults in 28.125 LE per hour\n\nBut
  this is way less than the minimum allowed by upwork (min of 3$ = 3*15.79 = 47.37
  LE)!!! \nActually beginner free lancers charge at 5$ (78.95 LE) and 10$!!\n\nHe
  said that I should not be comparing the prices here In Egypt to upwork!\n\nI searched
  in vain, Most Arabic resources discussing salaries and rates are not so useful and
  have no mention of prices in Egypt\nhttp://www.badwi.com/blog/?p=53\n\nThe only
  useful resource I could find is a survey about Egyptian salaries that was posted
  here a few month ago \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FY7Y00vn5rkpvq2mJVZ7JO2ThJttzXjsJBdJsqBHwTE/edit#gid=0\n\nI
  understand that hourly rates vary by many factors (experience, language, tools etc)
  but, I'm only interested in how to determine the the minimum and average rate in
  general.\n\nSo should we follow the freelance website prices ? How Egyptian software
  companies charge clients ? Do we consider Dollar price into out calculations ? Is
  there any other way of determining the cost of software ?\n\nAnother question, \nFor
  a fresh graduate software engineer in Egypt how can I decide if I'm being offered
  a fair salary when I cant find such available statistics?"

    message: I think u can't compare freelancing websites to us for some reasons ..
      the most important is that people offering jobs there from western countries
      will probably use their websites in an environment where the profits will be
      higher, by the same ratio, than the profits made by Egyptian startups and companies
      .. so for example a way to compare can be the minimum wage in US vs the average
      salary of regular junior developer in US against the Egyptian minimum wage to
      predict the Egyptian average salary .. I'm not sure that this is the right way
      but it's theoretically valid.

    message: "There are several ways to calculate the fee structure but at the end
      of the day, it's a negotiating game. \n\nFor the person hiring, you look at
      how much it would cost you to hire someone else to so the job, and start taking
      offers. That could be hiring full time employee, or contracting a company for
      a fixed price with set deliverables. \n\nAs for the person doing the work, i
      think accepting an offer that is simply an hourly rate of a full time job is
      the worst thing they can do. Typically a freelancer should either charge you
      a price that is near your other offers (if we are talking about a fixed budget),
      or it should be an the hourly rate of a full time salary TIMES a factor (minimum
      1.5). The employer can't pay the lower cost of a full time salary rate without
      the full time employment commitment. It's simply not fair. The freelance developer
      doesn't have the job security a fulltime job offers, yet can offer you a lower
      cost and more flexibility. \n\nWhat really matters here is their ability to
      deliver quality work that would have cost you multiple times more had you hired
      a company. Depending on what you want and their portfolio, either options could
      be better."

    message: As far as I know a lot of Egyptian startups are actually doing their
      business for foreign clients which pay them in USD or Euro and those startups
      will still pay you in Egyptian currency and maybe even far below the decent
      average of a software engineer because why not, you know
