      @funny japanese characters: writing open source on an image doesn't make the hardware open source.
      They haven't released any schematics or sources yet as far as I can see and their chip producer (Allwinner) has repeatedly shown it doesn't give a shit about open source:

      The chip producer confirmed it's just marketing. It will retail at $39 not $9.

      Islam Negm No, it's not. It's clever marketing.
      You already got backers who will pay to get your product on the market. You don't need a Kickstarter campaign, but you do it anyway to attract attention. You make it get viral so every tech blog talks about it and you get early backers:

      Technical early backers will appreciate a $9 SoC that is able to run Linux. Currently it can't run the mainline kernel so they need people to contribute to this.
      Not too technical people are more likely to purchase the expensive addons like the $15 HDMI adapter. Shipping is also quite overpriced.

      If they break even money-wise, which the probably won't, they still made a very good deal:
      Amazing publicity and community-developed software.
      After that they can go back to business as usual and sell it at a different retail price.
