message: "Dears,\nRsyncHero is one of my opensource projects for Linux servers backup
  based on ( Python + Django + SQLite)\nhttps://github.com/RamyAllam/RsyncHero\n\n[Core
  Features]\n1. Free and OpenSource project licensed under GPLv3.\n\n2. Threaded backup
  solution as it works on speeding and optimizing the backup process of Rsync by running
  parallel pool of workers for Rsync.\n\n3. Simple Web console to manage the whole
  backup process and manage your clients.\n\n4. Users and Authentication system.\n\n5.
  Template of files/folders names and extensions to exclude during the backup process
  such tmp and cache files to speed up the backup process and to save disk space and
  bandwidth.\n\n6. Email notifications system to send a health report of the backup
  process whether it's successful or there are any failed process.\n\n7. Logs for
  the backup process which stores the stdout and stderr and display the contents from
  the web console.\n\n8. List and Restore backup option from Web Console to review
  or restore. You still have the ability to manage your data from the backup server
  using SSH.\n\n9. Pre-defined list of common paths to backup for cPanel servers.\n\n10.
  View current running backup process for each server from the web console.\n\n11.
  Kill all running backup process for each server from the web console.\n\n12. Test
  SSH connectivity to the server.\n\n13. Light-weight SQLite database which stores
  all the backup configuration. So that you can backup your backup configurations
  and it will be simple for migratation across multiple servers.\n\n[Why?]\nI'm not
  sure if I'm reinventing the wheel, But i had a long journey with ( I/O, Kernel Crash,
  HIGH TTR ) issues with both free and enterprise backup solutions. So, I came along
  with my own code with the help of the great and powerful Rsync utility and there
  are still too much work to be done on the roadmap. \n\nI'm sharing it here and hope
  this might be useful for SysAdmins or Python developers who may be interested in
  such projects.\n\n[Request]\n- Professionals, There is always a better way to do!\nYour
  feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. It's licensed under GPLv3. So,
  feel free to fork and spread the world.\n\n- Frontend developers, I need your help
  in the webpages design. The current design is a slow suicide but this is what it
  looks like when a sysAdmin holds a painting brush :D\n\n- Users, Despite the fact
  that I'm using RsyncHero on a production system with +200 machines with different
  purposes. It's your environment and your choice to use it with no single line of
  warranty. YOU WILL encounter bugs and YOU WILL have recommendations So, GitHub issues
  is your friend.\n\nThanks!"
