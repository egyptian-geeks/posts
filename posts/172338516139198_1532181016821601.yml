    message: I think we need to define what you mean by over qualified? What were
      your expected qualifications for a typical candidate? And what were the candidate's
      qualifications that were over your expectations?

    message: What if he couldn't get a better job so he decided to lower his standards
      a little bit?! So it's not possible to lower standards if you actually "need"
      a job right now and can't get a suitable one?!

      Maybe start with defining the problem with hiring someone who you presume over qualified

      Are you afraid he will not respect authority ? Get better offers fast and leave ? Discuss every task ?
