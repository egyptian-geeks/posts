  I never really got the point behind AI until I read this comment:
  "If we made those same moves, Our teachers would slap our wrists. They’d smack me!, You don’t push from behind on the fifth line!"

  Not only AI might help a computer to think like humans, but it might even think better. It would have the resources and the time to question human beliefs and conventional wisdom. The stuff we just don't have the time to question.
