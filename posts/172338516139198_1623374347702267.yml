  In a company of scale 20-30 employee, management system software new version is required, which needs Windows 8.1 minimum. So, which is better? Upgrade PCs and laptops OS from Windows 7 to 8.1 or upgrade to 10?
  Specs are limited to the very old 1st gen core i5 processors, no budget available for hardware purchases, only OS license.

    message: to be honest i dont think upgrading to win8.1 or win10 is going to increase
      the performance of the machines or add any value for the users, win7 sp2 is
      perfectly stable and is supported by almost every single windows software

    message: Either stick to 7 or upgrade to 10. And my recommendation is to stick
      to 7 considering the hardware. Windows 10 is not that light compared to 7. And
      Windows 7 is perfectly stable and very very smooth so no good reason to upgrade
      unless there is a specific feature you want in Windows 10

      Windows 10 drivers and whether you will have support or not.
