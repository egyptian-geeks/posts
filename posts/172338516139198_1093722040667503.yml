message: "Hey guys, \n\nA client asked me to make a desktop app for him that changes
  the PC's proxy every minute or so (you can guess why, but I didn't even ask him).
  After looking around for away I found that services like Hola VPN does this, and
  it's for free, BUT it's not programmable (Doesn't have an API or something I can
  talk to programmatically :( ).\n\nMy question: is there away through which I can
  programmatically change the machine's (it's a Windows Server BTW) proxy setup depending
  on service or a tool like Hola ? Or really any other way.  \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nPS:
  The one solution I could come up with was to use the Hola Chrome extension and use
  NodeJS to control the mouse and trigger the change, but we all know that this is
  stupid and unreliable (but I tried it and it's working :) ). If you are wondering
  about the mouse being controlled by code and not by the user, know that this software
  will be running on a remote Windows/Linux server, and wont be accessed that much."

      To change proxy settings for IE you can set the following Registry Keys:
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
      ProxyEnable (0 or 1)
      ProxyServer (string containing ip:port)
      You can automate their change using batch scripts, powershell scripts, or C# :)

      For firefox you'll probably have to change a SQLite file, and for chrome it'll probably be a json file
