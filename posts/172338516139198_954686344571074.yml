  جوجل ويوداسيتي أعلنوا عن ٢٠٠٠ منحة للمصريين في برنامج Android Nanodegree وأيضا فعاليات توظيف للخريجين منها.

  انا حاليا مسجلة لبرنامج Front End Nanodegree والبرنامج جدا رائع وأنصح جدا بالتسجيل لبرنامج الأندرويد خصوصا أن المساقات تم انتاجها بمساعدة جوجل ويتم الان تعريبها وتوفير ترجمة بالعربية.

  ملاحظة: البرنامج ليس للمبتدئيين. يجب أن يكون عندك خلفية في البرمجة.

      Thanks in advance :)

    message: "It's a pretty cool program that I am enjoying very much, they focus
      a lot on giving you skills that are good for the market so you have to finish
      some tasks related to your resume and add the projects that you did so far and
      keep your profile updated. They have a timeline with projects that are asked
      form you, they also give you recommended classes to attend in order to finish
      the project, even though I already worked with fron end technologies I watched
      even the introductory classes about stuff I already know, because they have
      awesome developers that already have jobs as front end developer and who would
      give you a lot of advices on how you should write your code and how to start
      with a task, and all these small things that make a difference in the code you
      write.\n\nThey let you use github extensively to have all your projects there
      so recruiters can take a look when/if you apply for a job and see that you indeed
      know what you're talking abotu and actually worked with it. \n\nProjects cover,
      HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTML5 Canvas, Object Oriented Javascript, Website optimization,
      using APIs like maps, and Javascript testing. \n\nYou get feedback for every
      project you submit. My last project included feedback about good things I've
      done, and feedback on small things I should fix, like a missing semicolon, adding
      other browsers support for animation, removing an empty function that I forgot
      about, and some missing html closing tag. This was the thing I built, which
      is an online resume I customized for something they provided us with, as I am
      following up with Intro to Javascript course:\nhttp://rashahussein.github.io/online-resume/\n\nAnd
      this is the code: https://github.com/RashaHussein/online-resume"

      Thank you for the information.
      Very interesting work, Good for you :)
      I think i have a pretty good experience in those techniques.
      But if i may ask, who's responsible for this program?

    message: "Udacity and Google are behind it. This project was pretty basic for
      me, I already had an online resume, but built it anyway, because I wanted feedback
      on my code structure and I am more conscious to building well organized code
      this way. They gave me good feedback on the modularity of my code which I never
      had in the online resume that I built on my own, the code was all over the place
      (www.rasha.me) ! I kinda also learned more about how to build your own templating
      system, which I never thought about. i mean I know how templating works but
      never thought of building my own and how would that be like.\nThey ask that
      you have prior experience in the topics listed, but of course if you already
      have extensive experience in them, then no need to take it. It's not a zero
      to hero program, it's to enhance your already existing skills. The main thing
      about it is you building the projects, and following up with the career program
      they have setup for you, including hangouts with udacity people. You can skip
      the classes if you think you know what's in there. however I didn't skip any
      class, i think I am a big fan of those guys! I also always have something to
      learn, I usually watch the classes on a 2X speed though, cause most of the info
      in the intro classes was stuff I know. However the classes on mobile web, responsive
      design, responsive images and optimization, were full of good stuff and good
      practices I didn't know about. \n\nThe next project is an Arcade Game. This
      one is supposed to be challenging. \n\nThe guy who founded udacity is the same
      one who founded Google X. And he wants to revolutionize education! They're adding
      more nanodegrees. I might consider getting into the mobile world sometime later."

      Sounds cool :)
      However i prefer the online materials and documentations to learn any new technology. Books also is so great method to learn.
      I think courses might be waste of time but looks like you found it useful for you.
      wish you best of luck :D
      By the way if you interested in JS i write some articles about it here you might like Geeky Quizzes
