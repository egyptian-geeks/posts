  - description: "Download your latest 30 Github Gists to local directory\n\ngithub
      API is very simple REST API, similar to Facebook Graph API\nif you sent a GET
      request to some URL will respond in JSON with \nthe entity data.\n\nGithub API
      rate limit is 60 request per hour per IP address, so\nyou'll hit teh limit pretty
      fast if you don't have an authorized \napplication, Oauth applications gets
      upto 5,000 requests per Hours\nPer IP address, this script uses a non authorized
      approach.\n\nfirst you'll get the users first page of gists, to get second page\nyou
      need to add \"?page=2\" to the end of URL, but as we said we can't\ndo this
      because of the rate limit, if you'll use the second approach \nthen you're welcome
      to add this parameter and increase it each time.\n\nsecond we'll iterate over
      all gists and make directory for each using\nits unique ID and save the gist
      files to that directory.\n\naaaand its done, you have your latest 30 gists in
      a your local machine\nin no time. :)\n\nGist: https://gist.github.com/9547245"
