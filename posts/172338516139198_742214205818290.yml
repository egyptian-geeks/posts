      He is talking about why people are not investing with all of that.

      The fact of the matter is, the only thing that move people to do anything is money and it is not in Android.

      Even if you use ads the monetization strategy tons of Android users use ads blocker.

      Android generally is so poorly developed that same Windows Phone on same hardware is far better than Android (it is huge when u see them side by side)

    message: i totally agree with you in everything even that Android has the biggest
      market share comparing to iOS users. iOS still makes a lot more money than android
      developers. I think it's a culture orientation. iOS users are most likely paying
      for a product they like or they need Android users crack it :)

    message: Google is taking steps to move Android (Kitkat security...etc) closer
      to the enterprise and i think it could be a market there for business apps specially
      that it's now undeserved on that platform.

      with Android.\n\niOS already passed DoD tests and it is officially usable by
      most of US government officers \n\nAnyways, Android got the impression of cheap
      and it is nearly impossible to change that, many developer managed to make money
      on Windows Phone more than Android"
