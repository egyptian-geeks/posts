    message: Actually I've got an advise from a colleague before leaving the company
      that I'm good developer but unfortunately you're bad in marketing yourself,
      you were sitting there in your office for one year I never know you're a good
      developer till I worked directly with you. From this time and I'm working on
      this point, and I really believe Jeff Atwood is honorably true :)

      This is an excellent book. Actually, it's one of the few books that I read cover-to-cover, on an iPhone
