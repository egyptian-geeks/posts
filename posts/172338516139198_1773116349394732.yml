message: "iOS - Swift\nI'm working on an app that uses MapKit and I just wanna add
  both a \n- \"Favorites\" table view that has all of the favorites annotations (pins)
  that's the user favorited (by a button of course).\n- and a \"Recents\" table view
  that contains all of the previous pins.\nI tried to google it, but didnâ€™t get to
  anything."

    message: "If you are allowed to use google maps ios sdk use it instead of Apple's
      Mapkit, you will find it easier to use.\nYou mean you would like to add a search
      like tableview ?\nUsually you have the map filling the whole view so ... \nThe
      most elegant way is to add a search bar on top that drops a tableview once you
      start typing or so ...\nThis video might help you \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aegohk-3ffo"
