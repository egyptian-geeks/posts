message: As you may know, Government authorities banned all free voip services included
  Facebook messenger, WhatsApp call, Viber, IMO, and the only available solution to
  go around and solve this issue is to use a VPN, this post is for you all to discuss
  and give you recommendations.

    message: Yes VPN is the way to go, you can get a cheap Linux VPS server somewhere
      in Europe and setup OpenVPN your self (check this tutorial for example (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-16-04)

    message: You got the option to use tunnelbear free 500MB. But there is another
      option, PIA (Private Internet Access) VPN, for example, will cost you 40$ a
      year. This might be a lot of money for us, but this subscription covers 5 devices.
      Most people will need only 2 devices (one for pc and one for mobile). This means
      that the same account can be shared with others as long as the online devices
      is less than or equal to 5. You can share the cost with 1 or 2 of your friends
      and this won't affect your VPN. Some people might find this option useful
