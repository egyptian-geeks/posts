    message: "layout is the most expensive since it makes the browser to recalculate
      the position of page elements and then triggers painting and then compositing.
      that's why animating properties that triggers layout makes severe consequences
      on page performance and frame rate.\npainting has less cost than layout but
      it's the developer job to find what areas of the page are painted and try to
      minimize it as possible as he can. the worst thing for page performance is having
      continuous paints for the whole page within every frame. \ncompositing has the
      least effect on the page performance as it promotes the targeted elements to
      a separate layer and animation is handled by gpu. the properties that triggers
      composite only are opacity and transforms. that's why it's advisable to try
      to fit all page changes and animation within these properties. more resources
