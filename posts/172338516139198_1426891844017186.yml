      you got paid for that, so it is not yours anymore!
      you can always ask your client, but unless he/she gives you permission to do that, then it is not ethical!

    message: No, it is not unless they allow it. It is also not ok to use the same
      code for another company project unless that is in the contract you signed since
      normally they own the source code.

    message: "NO, but incase you are only sharing a part that's not the sale point
      this can be a grey area. ( the components you reuse in all your project )\n\nFor
      example: If you coded a Complete eCommerce website,  and you want to share the
      paypal payment plugin you wrote. this can be partly acceptable \n\nBUT if someone
      asked you to write a paypal payment plugin specifically, you can't share it
      because that's the thing you sold.\n___\nImagine the client downloading it from
      github and filing a dispute that he wants a refund because you sold him something
      publicly available and free for everyone else."
