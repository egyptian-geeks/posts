    message: That will actually make .NET development a revolution :D i would love
      to be able to use .NET on MAC or Linux Now I can (I think so)

    message: Mono has enabled that for ages, and it gets better with time and Xamarin's
      reliance on it (because Xamarin is commercial, it is able to push money into
      Mono, as it relies on it). But it's surely a revolution for Microsoft.

      the hero behind making Azure a good offering instead of crap.

      However, your comment conveys the meaning.

    message: I see what you mean. Well, web based IDEs are not new at all, and as
      discuss this is quite revolutionary for Microsoft. I don't think they'll be
      on it too much.

    message: It may be one of those features that'll exist half baked just to tick
      the box in a todo-list called "what cool kidz say they don't use us because
      we don't have it". It may be a good offering too. Until someone gets a proper
      first hand experience, I don't think an educated opinion can be made.
