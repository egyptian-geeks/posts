  could anyone tell me why finding collision is 2^(n/2) while finding second-preimage is 2^n?

  "then the cost of finding a collision is 2n/2, while the cost of finding a second-preimage is 2n (i.e. a lot more)."

    message: "The idea is simple \nIn collisions you are tasked to find any two numbers
      that produce the same hash, which gives you a lot of freedom and hence it is
      easier than when the task is second pre-image which is to find a number that
      produces a specific hash, it basically means you have to go through the whole
      search space -in the worst case scenario- to find at least one number that generates
      the same hash which is 2^N where N is the number of hash bits\nThe collision
      is easier because of something called the Birthday Paradox which puts an upper
      bound of the square root of the size of the search space hence 2^(N/2)"
