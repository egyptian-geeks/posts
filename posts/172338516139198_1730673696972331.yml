    message: It is very early to choose between them while he has no experience. Most
      important now is to learn basics of programming and different concepts behind
      different branches of programming.

    message: "TL;DR The web has the more potential \n\nWhy Android?\nAndroid when
      he knows what he will do there exactly... maybe an idea that may go viral? maybe
      some mobile business plans? maybe a cool company? otherwise, he will get stuck
      as a normal Android developer\n\nWhy The web?\nIt's actually working on Android,
      iOS and All devices in the world!\nSo you actually hit many birds with one stone.\nhave
      a look at this ;)\nhttps://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/mobile-game-development-with-the-device-orientation-and-vibration-apis/\n\nHere's
      a real-world example:\nWhy Android TVs have disappeared and webOS gained more
      popularity with TVs? maybe more cross-platform-ly?  maybe more secure and less
      APIs to mess with than Android 28 different API versions? maybe fast development
      cycle? maybe more developers?\n\nbut there are some cons... web developing is
      not the best-optimized thing. google is working on encouraging more optimization
      goodies and that will make a difference to web future for sure. Learning being
      careful with resources would be best with lower level languages, and \"there
      always a better practice\".\n\nAlways remember he will never regret something
      he has learned.. here we choosing between good and better, and being a flexible
      Software Engineer a lot better than sticking to certain technology or framework,
      people who did that still writing VB till now... Don't do that and always enjoy
      the journey ^^\n\nI hope that helps"
