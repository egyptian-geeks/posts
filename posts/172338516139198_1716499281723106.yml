    message: "Wow, are you guys for real? \n\nOk, so just so that the rest of the
      planet doesn't think this group is *only* full of misogynists... I'd like to
      register that he is full of it and will most likely terribly lose his case.
      \n\nIt's not a technicality to show the court that his \"discriminated group\"
      is making more than anyone else at Google. The first thing you have to show
      in a class action lawsuit is that the issue is systemic to a group of people.\n\nBut
      I am amazed at how blind we are to our own issues... You do realize that he
      is arguing for American managers making more than Egyptian and Lebanese managers
      at Saudi companies, American developers being paid higher than Egyptian developers
      who are more skilled. American developers being promoted faster. How many of
      you are in support of that? How can you say you hope to see him win for \"all
      of us\"... What \"us\" do you think contains \"you\" and \"him\"?"

      I wish Trump gets elected again. The dude is solid as well. I wish he wins again for all of us.

      It is so unfair to ditch a privileged, racist, and sexist white man just to be politically correct.

    message: "He won't win. \nHe only got fired when the memo became public, and threatened
      Google's public image, this is within Google's right.\nAlso, enforcing diversity
      hires is not illegal, especially when you want your company to have an equal
      representation of each gender/race because you value the difference of opinion
      it brings to the table. Imagine this: a woman's magazine (Cosmo or something)
      that hires staff only based solely on qualification. The truth is, statistically
      they will end up with a 70% male staff, but this won't be ideal because this
      is a woman's magasine and they need articles written from a woman's prespective.
      And so they enforce a minimum quota for both males and females in order to end
      up with a fair representation of both sexes. This is not illegal.\n\nI can go
      through his paper and agree with some of his points and disagree with many others,
      but we don't have time for this in a post, I am just talking about the case
      from a legal prespective."

      you have been brainwashed with western pop culture political correctness and
      you need to take the red pill to get out of this matrix.
