    message: I don't thik you can push notifications if you app is not running in
      the background. one thing you can do is to make a background worker to check
      for the json file searching for new messages.

    message: Once your app is installed and established a connection with Apple Push
      APIs or Google Push APIs you will be able to do that when the app is offline,
      in fact this is the primary goal of push notifications.
