      when u deal with App need Multi timezones Just use only unix timestamp and make one function take the date And User timezone to show it (when u want to print this date ).
      and in internal APP logic  use it with (UTC) timezone

      i think this becouse u try to convert it client side
      i am working in many projects using this
      what i mean is make every thing server side
      get date by time() => unix timestamp
      save in DB
      And when u print date to user , convert with server side script
      but when use date like (2014-04-13) it will take long time in parse it Spechialy on long list

    message: My original question had a typo, I asked if you watched the value, while
      I meant the video. The reason is that Unix time is addressed near the end. I
      will not comment further, except saying that setting your server to UTC as you
      said is a good idea.

      I really like all Tom Scott's videos on Computerphile:
      http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96C35uN7xGLux5q2c4P_IqbKF11-pfsR
      Even if I already knew everything about the topic, it's still very interesting to hear it in a very simplified manner :)
