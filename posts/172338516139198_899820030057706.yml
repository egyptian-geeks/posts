  recommendations from your content to your visitors, \n\nit works with Arabic and

  wondering if there are website owners who would be interested in testing it out

      we're interested in and it also connect to all major social networks API like
      Twitter , FB , YouTube and others. This allows us to monitor trends and figure

      ur pages that renders the related content, kinda like how a facebook share integrates
      with websites."

      Gravity has published a blog post a while ago about how they build the interest graphs, it is not really technical, but will give you a hint.

      Let me be frank, it's awful how such systems can and WILL destroy the variety, and the creativity.
      I'd write one unique article a day rather than write 10 via such system.

    message: "Mohamed Samir thanks for the feedback :) . The system merely recommends
      content based on the personal interests of the visitors, it doesn't give predictive
      analysis (not yet at least) to the content creator. \nwe're big fans of diverse
      content in both Arabic and English and one of our goals is to provide a channel
      to motivate people to create a high quality arabic content, it's lacking behind
      compared to English and other Latin based languages :)."

      Thanks Mohamed Yahya for your patience and understanding.

      Anyway, we should encourage and support anyone with intention to contribute enrich the Arabic content, however, my advice to you is to focus the efforts on the Arabic content.

      And definitely I will check it later.
