      Yes knowing python is required however you don't have to be an expert...
      You guys interested in django with python check the new Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS), It turns Visual Studio into a real python IDE that supports django with intellisense, debugging, profiling and much more

    message: "I've used Python for many years, and it's a great language. Django is
      one of many different web frameworks for Python, and it will help you learn
      more about the power of Python.  \n\nThere are a lot of web frameworks for Python,
      because it's easy to build your own web framework, but don't try to learn all
      of them because this will waste your time. I advise you to learn Django well,
      then you can check other frameworks\n\nYou should start with the Django tutorial
      (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/), then work on a medium project & start
      picking different parts of the framework (caching, ORM, templates, etc). You
      can check the Django book (http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/index.html), but
      it doesn't cover the latest versions, so you'll need to go back to Django documentation
      to learn the newest parts\n\nFinally, please run this command after you install
      Python, and make sure you understand everything that is written\n\nc:\\> python
      -c \"import this\""
