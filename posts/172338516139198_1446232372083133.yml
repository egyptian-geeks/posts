  Guys I wanted to pick your brain on a trend I noticed about Egyptian and gulf startups. Most of startups are mainly focused on launching a mobile app and building a one pager website that promotes downloading the app without having the service available on the website or mobile web.

  Don't get me wrong mobile-first is a good approach if it uses the benefits of mobile web but only relying on an app has a number of downsides. Here are a few cons:

  1. Losing SEO traffic, if you don't build a site you potentially lose tens or hundreds of thousands of potential monthly visitors.
  2. User aqusition costs are much higher for an app once you go through the paid search and advertising.
  3. Not focusing on having a mobile web limits your growth opportunities and ties the hands from any potential  guerrilla marketing and growth hacking techniques.
  4. You loose the flexibility of running hypothesied experiments and A/B tests. There are fantastic tools such as optimizely that can help you with these test and Google optimize now launched a free version. It is still possible to do A/B testing on apps but it takes a lot of developer time and are much slower and hader to depoy.
  5. Apps are no longer as sexy as they used to be a few years ago. There is actually a dropping trend in number of downloads in many app categories.

  Share your thoughts and tell me. Why would I develop a mobile app with no website that provides the same service?

      It's a valid approach only if the product is more  mobility-related .. like Uber for example.
      If not .. you are totally right

      Not all apps has content to make use of SEO, most provide services for on the go users capitalizing on high mobile penetration

      Even apps with content centric service like Instagram have a strong strategy to be mobile app only services with no way to share content from web

      We were "web first" before going the app route
