    message: 2. I don't know Inoic (on my list as it's booming), but in similar frameworks,
      you usually have to have some margin or padding to push the content after the
      fixed position header

    message: 3. It's a JavaScript framework. The API doesn't build on a lot of JS
      concepts at user front, so, it's not an absolute requirement, but JS is full
      of gotchas, and you could fall into these with any JS framework even Angular.
      Knowing these helps avoid wasting time pulling your hair because of something
      that you just didn't know works in an illogical way.

      Mohamed Meligy thx for ur answers ^^
      but 1. I need to seperate the dev tools completely in a new win ... the button u mentioned just changes the position of it  if horizontal or vertical in the same window

      2. It's my first time using an UI framework I used to develop my apps completely from zero ... I tried overwriting the framework css by a style.css file and messing with some paddings or margins .. nothing happened !? so should I change the main css ?!!

      3. JS is really weird :) ! u can't figure out where the problem easily .. so ur advice to knowing more JS concepts ? and trying again with AngularJS .. ^_^ !
