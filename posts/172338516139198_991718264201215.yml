  Here is my experience with VPSDime if u are just interested

  "Akheeran (after 2 days of configuration), I'm done from installing & configuring Centos 7 on my new VPS. Moving from shared hosts to VPS is a must. I got my 7$ monthly VPS (Unmanaged) from VPSDime with 6GB of Ram and 30GB SSD Space. So far, its a great experience ! i didn't expect that i'd get such specification with only 7$/month. I regret the time i waste in shared hosts."

      "What happens if my VPS receives frequent DoS/DDoS attacks?We cannot tolerate frequent DDOS attacks, as such we will suspend your VPS and we will kindly ask you to leave with a prorated refund for your remaining days."

      So, instead of offering DoS/DDoS protection, they threaten to terminate the VPS. I guess "cheap" comes with a price.

      I have bad experience with Unmanaged VPS (windows based on softsyshosting  hosting company), First you have to have enough experience of administration , you have provide a lot of services already available in managed hosting , like backups , security , disaster recovery , protection,...
      and finally we fallen with DDoS Attack , and the cheapest service you can find for protection was 86$ per domain per month.
