  Dear Geeks,

  I just need your opinion about something. Do you prefer to work with a project manager that has technical knowledge or one of those "business only" people who wouldn't know how to write a Hello World program and why?

  I am asking this cause I have had good/bad experiences with both and wonder if it is just me or do other people have the same experiences as me?

    message: I once met a PM who was an Engineering Grad, she was going to meet the
      CFO of a multinational company to "gather the financial system requirements".
      I asked her "Do you know anything about Finance?". "I am an Engineer " She said.
      "But do you know what a financial staement is? Do you know even Debit and Credit?"
      I said. "No, it will be easy, Engineering is hard. Accountants go to Tegarah,
      so it should be easy for me" she said. "But this is the CFO of a multinational
      company and has international certifications in finance, how are you even gonna
      understand what he is saying", I said. "How hard could it be ?" She said. :)
      Obviously, I don't need to explain what happened :) BTW, this is a REAL story,
      NOT a joke :)

    message: I have a business PM, and I think both kinds have pros and cons.. the
      cons are obvious, because there are things that you're going to take time to
      do that he won't easily understand.. You're gonna have to put some effort to
      assure him that you're not slacking. On another note, a technical only manager
      can fail by great deals in situations like the one Mohamed has mentioned...
      a business person with an IT background (even if they don't code), or a technical
      person with business experience make the best managers in these cases, yet they're
      the developer's worst nightmare, for obvious reasons :p

      1. Working with a non-techie puts a responsibility on me to explain things in simplified terms.

      2. If he doesn't believe me, then it's a matter of trust. Why did he accept to work with me if he doesn't trust me?

      3. You might say that he doesn't know me to trust me. I would reply & say that he doesn't know me to accuse me of lying to him.

      4. I would also tell him that I can satisfy him & give him a small estimate & he will be happy for now, but at the end my estimate is the realistic one. We will be late, he will lose money & at some point in time he will close his company or layoff half of his employees. He will also lose the trust of the client.

      5. For all of this to happen, I must do my best to make the estimates realistic. Two stories to mention here

      I was working with a non-techie client on a freelance project & I put the delivery date after 2 months. When he said that it's very late, I told him that the reason is that I can work for 6-8 hours per week. He asked me to make the deadline closer (& hence work more hours per week). This needed more time & family management (& he knew this), but I made it for him in the end.

      Another story with a techie manager - who didn't trust me then. He objected that I made 2 weeks as an estimate. I showed him the detailed schedule of tasks, assigned time, execution plan & buffer time. He said that the _standard_ for a buffer can't exceed 25%. I told him that 30% is more realistic according to my experience. He changed the buffer percentage, to find out that it only saved him 2 hours only! At the end we kept my estimate.
