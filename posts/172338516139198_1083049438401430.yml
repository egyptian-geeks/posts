  Hello guys, I don't know if many of you know about this, but I think it's really useful:
  This is Google's Guide to Technical Development
  It has a lot of useful courses and mainly important topics in Computer Science for anyone unsure what to do. It's not perfect and it lacks some stuff and doesn't mention C#/C++ which I think is super weird (but hey it's Google) but for the most part it's covers most of the basics.
  Sorry if this was posted here before.

    message: "It actually mentions C++. \nI will tell you something about programming
      languages ..... \n\n1. There are what is called Langauge Family ... \nIt's  two
      or more languages that they look like each other .. \nExample the C family.
      It has C, C++,C# , Java and maybe more that I don't know .\nSo learn one language
      from popular families .. \nLearn Classical OOP model langauge , learn interpreted
      dynamic language, learn a functional language .. \nDon't learn more than one
      language from the same family.\nEx. If you know C# and you wanna learn Java
      for the sake of learning Java you are wasting time.\n\n2. It actually doesn't
      matter which programming language do you use ... It's the concepts and techniques
      that language expose .."
