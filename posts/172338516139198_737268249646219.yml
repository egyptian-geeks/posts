      The problem has nothing to do with jQuery if I understood your issue correctly, hiding or disabling a select option is not cross browser,  It'll likely work on FF but not chrome, maybe IE8 but not Opera. You're better off just removing the option when it's not needed.

      If that's not the problem you're facing, I suggest you create a jsfiddle so I can reproduce your situation.

      On a second thought, maybe you can by wrapping the option with a span but that's gonna break per specs.
      Mohamed Sameeh Sharaf Could you try it on FF and chrome?

    message: Your solution only disables the element, which I suppose is what you're
      eventually seeking. Not having the option selectable, but it doesn't hide it
      on chrome. It'll likely work in FF but I can't verify that now.

      I saw code similar to this some 2-3 years ago but can't find it anymore. So here's a recreation http://jsfiddle.net/HNysu/1/
      It hides the option which should work on FF and wraps the option in a hidden span to hide it on Chrome, should also in theory work on IE if I recall correctly. The hidden span trick wont work on FF because it's actually invalid HTML.
      Nonetheless, this should be cross-platform. If anyone is kind enough to verify it, that'd be great.

      Good luck.

      Edit: Just noticed a bug, if you select nothing on the category, the products list wont return to showing the full list of products. So the fiddle is updated to solve this.
