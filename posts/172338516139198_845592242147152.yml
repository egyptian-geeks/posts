  How do you explain to your clients a bug like this ? This is basically breaking all the input elements on the internet that use the same value for height and line-height ...
  Do you use a workaround to fix it? (using padding and decrease the line-height for example?) or you just say we will wait for a fix which is supposed to arrive in a month or less?
  I am not seeking technical solution ... I am asking about how to handle the client.

      Alright, So you have to explain to the client that this is a Browser issue caused by an update that broke the textbox not only your website is affected but millions of other websites. (I would give him a sample websites)

      Now that you pointed the problem. Offer the solution. an easy solution would be using a polyfill or vertical align depends on how bad is the situation :D

    message: It is affecting websites like Google Groups for example ...I got your
      point ... Thanks Mohamed ... I don't think I will go for a work around. Too
      much to do ... calculating padding and height. It doesn't worth the effort.

      Handeling The Client: Show the client the error happening on google's own websites, like in the link: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome
      If google itself is facing the same issue, they can't argue.

      Actual Workaround: If it's possible, simply remove the Line Height property from the field, and just use the "height" property, it certainly fixes the issue in the link provided. Not sure about your website and how you are using the line-height property!

      Posting a link of your actual website with the issue would help as well ;)

    message: Ahmad Alfy I understand, remove the line-height property from your css
      for that text field,  or reset it to initial. That worked for me on google's
      website.

    message: Confirmed, you are right. I thought that's a bad behavior from Chrome
      but this is exactly the same on FF and IE too. Was it always like this? Ever
      since I started to write CSS I always thought I have to declare line-height
      on input. I am not sure but do you know if that's a recent change? Cause I am
      like 99.9% positive that that wasn't the case like 6 years ago :D

      See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/945812/497828
      That's a 5 years old answer on Stackoverflow asking about the exact same thing ... Back at this time achieving the vertical align was an issue ... Seems like the browsers treat it differently now!

    message: For sure, alot has changed since 5 years ago, css3 only acheived full
      implementation as soon as just 2 years ago, the turnover for browsers is very
      high. Last year you still had to write out different browser specific prefixes
      for many css properties, today the majority of them are standards and no longer
      need browser specific prefixes.
