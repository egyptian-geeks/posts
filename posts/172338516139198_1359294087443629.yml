  Guys, I'm trying to clone a repo from bitbucket (SSH), my laptop is connected to TEdata ADSL via wifi. each time I get the following error:

  fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
  fatal: early EOF
  fatal: index-pack failed

  I googled and found some advice that it might be a network issue.

  I tried to connect via cable & restarted the router with no luck.

  After that I connected via Etisalat 3G Hotspot and everything worked fine.

  My question is: Does any of you guys have recently encountered such issue? Would it be some sort of blocking via Tedata?

  Thanks

      found a reason but my interpretation is that it's a temporary outage in BitBucket.
