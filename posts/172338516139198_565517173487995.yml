      If you pressed the link in the post you'll know

      There are products which make me hate them deeply that I refuse to use any version whatever the enhancements are. IE is on the top of this list. I abandoned it since IE 6, and used it only for UI testing or stupid websites which refuse to work on other browsers

      1. Security sucks
      2. Very weak support for standards: no support for rounded corners till IE9, transparent PNG till IE7 (not sure which version) & many others
      3. Slow compared to other browsers
      4. The latest browser to include tabs
      5. Very few extensions compared to other browsers, and most are bloody spyware
      6. The developer toolbar sucks compared to Firebug or Developer tools in Chrome

      I'm not the only one who spent countless hours fixing stuff to work on IE

  - description: It makes me sad when I find out that a lot of people use bad tools,
      so here is a list of tools that I use almost everyday (as of May 2013). Most
      of them are great & some of them are acceptable. Feel free to suggest better
      tools.
