      I would suggest find a project. I personally read technical blogs and reddit to keep up to date on interesting things.

      I also like to spice up my pc with scripts that help me in my day to day. When I had windows I used autohotkey on linux I play with my xmonad config file plus some small scripts and utilities using dmenu/dzen2 to make my life easier (an app runner, a calculator, dictionary, connecting to my different networks). I also try to spice up my zsh prompt and vimfile.

      Basically anything that annoys me during normal work I try to fix when I am free.
