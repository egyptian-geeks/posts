message: Yesterday, a teammate celebrated his 65th birthday as an SDE (still coding).
  Some consider it a positive sign that the environment allows anyone to code as long
  as s/he wants. Others consider it a sign of a poorly progressed career. What you
  think?

    message: I think it is awesome. This guy is doing what he loves to do. I saw a
      guy on StackOverflow on his 60s asking a question showing that he understands
      :) Only in Egypt we consider that a pooly progressing career cause almost everyone
      wants to stop coding and move to Project Management and "Team leading" after
      becoming a "Senior" :) I don't plan to stop coding honestly :)

      enjoys it.

    message: "Both are right\n- It's awesome that he can code at this age, would be
      even more awesome if he can support himself financially and anyone he takes
      care of from coding (and that's what I'm expecting from the post).\n\n- It's
      a failure (read to the end if you disagree). I kept postponing this comment
      because I don't have a short version in my mind. But here's a try: \n\nAfter
      spending enough years in the field you realise it's more about people than it's
      about code. You learn so much about the dynamics of a good project. You learn
      how much bigger of an impact a good coach / mentor is any your project and on
      the devs they work with.\n\nYou realise that even as a coder you often have
      to have superior communication skills to make a difference (so, a good code
      is almost never someone who is bad with people skills).\n\nEventually you understand
      your value is your influence on people around you no matter what your role is,
      not primarily your skill. And the more influence the bigger the win obviously.\n\nChoosing
      to ignore this, (while a free choice) is a failure. Not realising that it's
      true at all is also a failure. The result of that failure is so many missed
      opportunities to make a bigger impact on the world.\n\nHowever, on a second
      thought, \"Failure\" can be defined by missing something you wanted. If you
      didn't want to have this impact, then maybe you didn't fail, but you lost /
      missed a lot of opportunities. So, feel free to replace \"failure\" above with
      \"loss\" / \"miss\"."
