      The title is a bit misleading so I just wanted to point out that Richard Stallman has always meant to talk about the freedom of the software, by freedom he means being able to edit the source code to fit your needs and to prevent malicious features implemented to track the users. Richard also thinks that ubuntu itself violates the freedom of the users so it is not just about Apple or Microsoft products.
      His intentions are good but nowadays no one would be able to edit or even compile huge software code anyway, it may take weeks to even compile the source code of such complicated systems anyway.

      once did and it was very short, I haven't tried a desktop environment yet, but
      compiling the kernel was minutes

      With all respect to Richard stallman we don't live in Utopia.
      I share the same hate towards windows and OSX ...etc.

      Let's be honest without propertary software , industries will collapse.

      Plus canonical did a great job with Ubuntu why the hate ?

      without proprietary, it is NOT about getting rid of proprietary, it is about
      having a free alternative. Anyone is free to create Proprietary, but people
      should be aware of Free alternatives and why they need to support them to support
      their Freedom.

      How many Linux users out there build their own kernel or even know how to do it out of the general population of all Linux users? Even more, how many of them actually modify the kernel?
      Same with all other open source software?

      I keep hearing that open software is the key and that it helps people have freedom and modify their software but at the end of the day, most people will just go download something and install it. How is that different from proprietary software exactly?!

      It’s like having 4x4 Car and claiming it’s better because you can drive it both on road and off-road but you never ever use it outside the highway
