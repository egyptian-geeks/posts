      The title is a bit misleading so I just wanted to point out that Richard Stallman has always meant to talk about the freedom of the software, by freedom he means being able to edit the source code to fit your needs and to prevent malicious features implemented to track the users. Richard also thinks that ubuntu itself violates the freedom of the users so it is not just about Apple or Microsoft products.
      His intentions are good but nowadays no one would be able to edit or even compile huge software code anyway, it may take weeks to even compile the source code of such complicated systems anyway.

      once did and it was very short, I haven't tried a desktop environment yet, but
      compiling the kernel was minutes

      With all respect to Richard stallman we don't live in Utopia.
      I share the same hate towards windows and OSX ...etc.

      Let's be honest without propertary software , industries will collapse.

      Plus canonical did a great job with Ubuntu why the hate ?

    message: Just to clarify, I am no putting him on a pedestal nor is he some legend,
      I am just saying he has some points. I don't think the industry would have collapsed
      without proprietary, it is NOT about getting rid of proprietary, it is about
      having a free alternative. Anyone is free to create Proprietary, but people
      should be aware of Free alternatives and why they need to support them to support
      their Freedom.
