      So yes, write your own framework. However, make sure that you get your hands
      dirty with existing frameworks first, not necessarily to the level of an expert
      but to understand what kind of problems they are trying to solve and what kind
      of features they have. This will allow you to know what kinds of things that
      you will need to implement in your framework. Writing your own thing will basically
      allow you to understand things that you either never notice that they exist
      or are too hard to understand with the level of abstraction you are dealing
      with when you use the framework. Anyway, once you understand the basics you
      will decide whether your framework is really doing something useful and end
      up pushing it further or just ditching it and contributing to other open source
      software. One last note: Make sure that you''re not delusional and keep testing
      your sanity.'
