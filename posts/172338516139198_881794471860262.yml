  Hi, I have a database of contacts that include mobile numbers with the old format, you know in 2011 there had been a shift in numbers format by adding a new digit. Are there a piece of software that can help me update the numbers automatically without the hassle of Excel tricks?

  I imagine there should have been a something to import CSV and do automatic update done. Anyone still aware of a software like that?

  Thanks a lot

      Yes it is possible, Guys, he want to apply this directly on the database file he have, not on his phonebook nor outlook  ,

      Can be done easily by doing a VBA script to do the conversion . Excel allow Macro, you can write a simple macro if you remember the formula of the conversion and run it on the numbers column.

      Mohamed Sameeh Sharaf: He could append any dummy character at the beginning of all numbers and then find and replace.
      e.g. replace x010 with x0100

      Don't complicate things. A group of regex will solve it. Here are more details

      You want to find 010, followed by 7 digits. You replace the 010 with 0100 and put the 7 digits as-is

      Here is how you do it in Python

      re.sub(r"010(\d{7})", "0100\1", "0101234567")
      => 01001234567
