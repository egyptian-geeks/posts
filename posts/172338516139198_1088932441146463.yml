    message: Look, Akka has many components that address different problems in any
      system. The good news is, you can only pick the parts that suites your solution.
      So if we take the Actors for example which is the core component in Akka, I
      think yes it can increase the parallelism in your system because actor model
      is the best in dividing computation on actors that share nothing between each
      other which make them safe from deadlocks. The question that you need to think
      about is do you have big jobs that can be broken down to small parallel jobs
      or not?
