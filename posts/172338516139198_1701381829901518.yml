  Did anyone try using Facebook login with react native app that depends on a rails API?

  I have a rails API that uses devise token auth and a react native app, now the sign in and sign up using email are working. But I am trying to implement sign in using Facebook.

  Previously, when I needed to do this in a web app I just used omniauth-facebook which authenticates through facebook and redirect to callback URI.

  Now, it's a bit confusing because there is a different flow of react native because there is the Facebook login that requires facebook SDK and it can handle all the login process. But I need to get the Facebook login working with the API to create user in the database and to track records of his activity on the app.
