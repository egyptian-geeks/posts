    message: Not exactly related by might be interesting for hardware enthusiasts,
      I found out that the latest AMD processors run at very high speeds, for example
      the FX-9590 runs at 4.7 GHz (and overclocks to 5.0 GHz turbo mode), has 8 cores
      and needs 220 W of power to operate ... such a beast, I can't imagine what kind
      of cooling it needs.

    message: Mmm. AMD processors are good, but my beast here have 20M cache editions,
      and 3.7 GHz without any overclocking.

      I didn't mean it's good, but just very power and cooling hungry :)
      this "beast" is beaten by the non-extreme i7 4770K in many tests :D كارثة
      for comparison, the i7 4770K runs at 3.5 GHz, has 4 cores and needs 84 W of power.
