  Aside from the journalistic social media hype, bash on windows explained by technical guys. And it is actually impressive.
  To sum up:
  - This is a kernel emulator, it emulates kernel APIs for Linux programs.
  - it handles File Modes and permissions and inserts them in NTFS extended attributes.
  - Currently IPv6 might have some issues. if you have IPv4 it should work fine.
  - You can run Ruby or Python and most of the GNU/Linux tools.
  - Currently the Linux process is separate from the Win32 world, it runs in its own session (a windows term that is somewhat similar to a container), so /bin/ps will not show Windows processes running on Windows. (Confirm?)
  - In the future they plan to span multiple Linux instances in multiple sessions, so each bash can be its own container (this might mean native docker support?)
  - Difference from Cygwin and Msys, these are compiled ports to Win32 processes, while now you can run actual linux compiled code.
  - Difference from the discontinued SFU that exists in Windows Server (Windows Subsystem [or Services] for Unix).
  The difference is that SFU was emulating user mode calls to Win32 equivalents which is a much larger number of API than the Kernel mode.
  - Not all the Kernel syscalls are implemented yet.
  - Linux apps run in a pico-process (search DrawBridge), so a linux app cannot call a win32 user-mode APIs (also win32 apps cannot invoke linux syscalls),

      Native Docker containers as well as Hyper-V Containers are just around the corner, they will be released with the next Windows Server 2016 release, and the preview is already out.

      actually worked so I decided to find out. This
