      Try redmine. You already have it. Its features compared to freshdisk is vert limited when it comes to support. But with very kittle tweeking, you can have a decent app agailable for customers.

      It can also handle email translation into tickets

    message: Jira has an open source version, but generally, it is a headache to configure
      specially if you need to do anything beyond ticketing like forms customization
      or remote API access.
