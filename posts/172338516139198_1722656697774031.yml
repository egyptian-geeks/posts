    message: I don't think taking the service offline would have helped though, the
      DNS settings was changed to point to a whole different website that is a clone
      of the original, typical DNS hijacking and Phishing, it is a terrible thing,
      and I bet it is either a social engineering attack against the domain provider,
      or worse some weak account settings that got the hacker into the domain control
      panel.

    message: "In order for the attack to succeed, certificates also had to be compromised.
      DNS by itself would not fool clients using HTTPS. If a client is trying to reach
      https://api.blackwallet.co to send it stuff, then it's not enough to just trick
      the client by pointing it to a different IP. \n\nSo, undiscussed in the article
      is... How did the keys get compromised?"

    message: "Mohamed Ahmed, to answer your starting question: How to protect against
      this?\n\nThis is theft of infrastructure, i.e. They hijacked who you are before
      your own security systems are even touched. Securing your infrastructure has
      several approaches and steps:\n1) Own your infrastructure. That's what big companies
      like Google and Microsoft and Amazon do. Their DNS entries are answered to by
      name servers they own, their \"WhoIs\" entries point to them and not some DNS
      provider like GoDaddy or 1and1. If you own your own infrastructure, you have
      to do all the work to secure it, protect against IoT DDoS attacks and so on.
      Most small companies do not have the time or resources to do that.\n2) Host
      your infrastructure with major cloud providers like Azure DNS or AWS Something.
      Basically, you buy the domain, you point it to *their* infrastructure and name
      servers and they expose config UI for you to set it up. This is the recommended
      approach in my mind for anyone serious enough about security of their infrastructure.
      These providers have built in security meaures like not allowing a CNAME for
      the root level domain and so forth. \n3) Cheapest option is host your DNS in
      a DNS provider like they did. \n\nFor both #2 and #3, you have to have a detailed
      plan of how you secure the accounts used to access that administration console.
      How will you fall back if that account is deactivated or compromised? Where
      is the \"red phone\" (to Azure or Amazon or GoDaddy) that you can use if someone
      takes over the account or if the account is deleted by accident. \n\nBut there'
      no code you can write inside your product that can save you from an infrastructure
      hijack, the users are not hitting your code. :)"
