      You will consider business plans, but they are much more expensive than home plans and require registered companies to setup.
      Other solutions may be you build your small load balancer and have 2 sources of internet i.e. ADSL and 4G.. So once the main line is down you automatically fallback to the standby line

      Of course you can get one from Vodafone. But you can go extra mile and buy a professional one with more features and higher speed for your home network to communicate faster.

      4g usb stick.. Forget about home dsl.. Your line might not be able to handle more than 8 or 9 mega bit.
      While 3g normal speed is about 10 mb.
      4g, personally didn't test it yet.

      I was in your shoes a few month ago but anyway here goes the steps of making maximum usage of your 16 mb line
      1- check and double and tripple check your phone cable does it have any cuts is it connected directly to the splitter...etc.
      2- replace the cable with the original sweedy phone line (take good care there are many clones sold as original so know your source)
      3- ask to speak to the supervisor / shift manager and id asked for a reason to fill the application just mention very slow connection and when he calls you back tell him your issue and ask the manager/supervisor to refresh your port (which might take up to 1 week to see the effect)
      4- if you're located in a crowded area/ far away from el central then you'll have 2 options either get a 4g modem or another line and get a MUX which will duplicate your speed eventually
