  Electronic Money Exchangers listed in this link to transfer money from Skrill (or
  other) to PayPal? \n\nhttps://www.okchanger.com/exchangers\n\nThis link provides
  the rate:\nhttps://www.okchanger.com/exchange/SKRILL-USD-to-PAYPAL-USD\n\nIs there
  anyone here who may benefit from paying small amounts (50 to 100 GBP) of his/her
  PayPal and get money instead? .. I'm not sure if this last question is allowed so
  kindly forgive me if not and let me know to amend the post."
