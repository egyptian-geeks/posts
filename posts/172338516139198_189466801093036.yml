  Maybe it's old news for you, but I just knew about this amazing site today.

  it let's you write, and test scripts online with many of the known frameworks out there (jQuery, Extjs, MooTools, Prototype, YUI, Glow, Dojo,..,)and many more including pure JavaScript.

  has some more neat features:
  - it let's you add your own JS or CSS to test against
  - many examples to learn from
  - it can even test your ajax calls :)

      the best part is that you can simply hit ctrl+S to simulate saves ( notice that the URL will change reflecting your recent version).
      so it's easy to write some code, save it , copy the URL, and send it to someone to see ( neat, is'nt it?:) ).
