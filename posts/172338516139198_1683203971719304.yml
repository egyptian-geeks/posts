message: "There is something I've been noticing that I need to hear the opinions of
  people who have extensive experience in software industry, Mohamed Elsherif. We
  as developers are divided to two groups: \n\nFirst group, ones who update their
  knowledge and skills, always try new tools and try their best to be ahead of the
  curve, but on the other side, they lack the soft skills to, for example, nogotiate
  their salaries, know their value in the market, have an idea about the politics
  of the place they're workign at, and finally they think about their career decisions
  in an emotional way, either towards a technology, or tool, or team, or specific
  people. \n\nSecond group, are the total opposite, they so outdated and produce low
  quality work, but know how to market that and how to report what they have done
  in a way that makes it look like extremely hard high quality one, and they have
  all the soft skills that the first group lack.\n\nI rarely see developer who have
  the the advantages of the two group. \n\nMy question is: do you also notice that,
  and if so, why do you think that happens, and what's the solution in your opinion?"

      I don't think there is a correlation between the two traits you're mentioning (keeping up to date and soft skills) like any two independent traits you will see all variations on the spectrum, bottom line is soft skills and people skills are as important as technical skills, we as Engineers and Geeks tend to see them as secondary even though we deal with situations every day that requires a great deal of people skills like negotiating and getting our ideas through other people and influence, Software Engineering is a team activity first and foremost, and teams can only function with clear communication and trust, which are hard to build if the members and leads lack good communication skills.
      For example, a mediocre manager can get his/her team burnt out because s/he couldn't negotiate better delivery dates and scope that makes sure his/her team gets a good work/life balance, or a team member can get himself/herself alienated because of his attitude towards other or his/her unwillingness to help other teammates and so on.

    message: Thanks for your reply, but I know they're not mutually exclusive, and
      despite of that, I keep seeing that. So, my question is, do you see that too?
      And what do you think is the reason?
