  Hello Geeks,
  I faced a statistical/probability term in data science field which i cant find its  mean, the term is "log bilinear".
  i know what is exactly meant by log linear which described nicely here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_model
  and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_analysis
  also i found a question here with no  real answer   http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-log-bilinear-model
  and also this http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/157136/log-linear-vs-log-bilinear

   Geeks help make it clear to me ...thanks in advance

    message: 'I know nothing about Data Science, but in graphics/rendering bilinear
      is just linear on two axis instead of one (eg: bilinear interpolation is on  4
      values on the x-axis and y-axis, while linear interpolation just happens on
      two values on one axis). Maybe something similar might be going on in data science,
      and maybe not :D'

  - description: A log-linear model is a mathematical model that takes the form of
      a function whose logarithm is a linear combination of the parameters of the
      model, which makes it possible to apply (possibly multivariate) linear regression.
      That is, it has the general form
