  what do you know about the term "recursive strings"
  the term was mentioned in (coding interview preparation e-mail of some company)
  and I couldn't find that term (as is) on the internet
  I know about recursion and some recursive operations on strings but what does that term mean?
  does it mean recursive operations on strings, or strings with size that grows dynamically using recursion or what?

    message: Yeah, it's not clear for me too. But most probably it's about recursive
      solutions for strings problems!
