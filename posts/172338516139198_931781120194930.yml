  As I predicted and I am sure this will be in the works for mass adoption soon or something like it.

  Python for Client side instead of  Javascript. Now  I can actually view source, READ the code and actually understand it.

    message: Ibraheem Osama Mohamed On Android there is Kivy for Python framework
      that makes building an app a piece of cake :) Actually, I can imagine a Python
      program running on windows phone and all that will be required is the Python
      interpreter and a couple of helper files in Python :) The funny thing is I had
      kidney pain yesterday and was very sad, when I saw this I was happy, not because
      Python can do client side, but the thought that JS will die.

      What I predict: A standard VM model for web browsers. No silly arguments about JS then, people will be able to compile their favourite assembly language to bytecode and just include it.
      And this book will become reality as it ought.

      But seriously speaking, I do think the asm.js approach is the future. Better than silly source level translation from python to javascript at **client side** (You are interpreting a subset of python on top of javascript to output a subset of javascript that you then can feed into the javascript interpreter; for what? so end users who shouldn't read the code anyway, can see python instead of JS?).

      Brython has been there for many years now. It's too late for it to become popular, unless it gets a killer app/framework.

      You can create your own VM to run Python in the browser. The hard part is convincing people to use it.

      Kareem Elansary yes, you can minimize Python.
