  work  ? that ISP's have no way of forging certificates or cracking encrypted packets
  ? \n\notherwise why would they go to the length of issuing a law and threat to close
  services like whatsapp and imessage \n\n"

      Very good question.
      Even if all present encryption can be bypassed, it doesn't mean that tomorrow encryption will be, also, it doesn't mean that all governments or even all government agencies have the technicality to break it.

      There's also a very important factor: the cost.
      To reach the technology that breaks encryption, it takes too much R&D, that is too much cost (money AND time). It's not bulletproof as well.

    message: Australia has been trying to do tracking for all user actions on the
      internet. The main issues (besides the obvious privacy ones) were danger of
      hacking, AND cost of not just storing but inspecting this, and the effect it
      could have on Internet speed.

    message: Similarly, also in Australia, they passed a rule recently that allows
      blocking websites (meant to be used for copyright violations). There are 2 ways
      to apply this, DNS poisoning, which can be bypassed by simply switching to something
      like Google DNS, or Deep Package Inspection. All pointers suggest ISPs will
      only use DNS Poisoning, due to high cost and performance effect of Deep Package
      Inspection.

      Regarding certificates, these (I think) can only be manipulated by CAs, which are hard coded into your OS / browser, so, if OS / browser vendors + CAs sell you out, you are doomed. Other dangers are unlikely.
      Douglas Crockford is thinking about a new alternative to HTTPS for this very reason :D
