message: "I want to build calendar on relational database it should handle booking
  slot in  event .\n every event has start and end time,\nEvent is divided to some
  number of slots.\nEach slot duration > 1m and less than event duration\n\nWe should
  return free and busy slots\nWe should support booking multiple slots in different
  events within the same transaction.\n\n------------\nMy solution\nI created event
  table have the following attributes [ id - start - end ] then created  slot table
  [ id - eventID - start - end - duration ] \nWhen you want free slots divide event
  duration  to small number of slots and XOR them with slot table.\nYou will get free
  slots on your event.\n------------\nIf you have better algorithm please leave comment."

      if you are working with .net, check this https://www.codeproject.com/articles/168662/time-period-library-for-net
      you will have only one table for event and you will be able to get the free and busy slots easily
