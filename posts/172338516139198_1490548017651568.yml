    message: JavaScript mainly is a scripting language as you know, made to be interactive
      with web pages, so you may find it poor of that kind of functionality which
      is already available and more improved in the procedural languages -Back-End-
      like Java or .NET

    message: "You can do it using canvas elements, pretty easy though.\n\nThe only
      drawback will be speed , canvas isn't GPU accelerated.\nSo if your need require
      performance you should Implement it with a library that supportsâ€‹ webgl\n\nMay
      I know more about your requirements to help you find a good library ? \n\nA
      Swiss army tool I always use for that stuff is pixi.js but it is kind of overkill
      sometimes"
