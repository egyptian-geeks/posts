message: "Rust has had and continues to have a rough climb uphill to their 1.0 release
  compared to Go. In particular the rapid changes in the language usually ends up
  breaking BC and as such breaking community libraries. This call for contributions
  showed up on their mailing list. \n\nFor anyone who's been meaning to hack on rust
  but not sure what to do or anyone already hacking on it but looking to make an impact.\nHappy
  coding\n\n"
