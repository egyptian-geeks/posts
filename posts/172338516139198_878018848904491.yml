    message: hahahaha they probably notice because if they use travis they should
      get notifications. Better see Facebook and their advance in MySQL and they even
      forked it and have their own modified version!

    message: Yes but in real time you have to consider other stuff! I imagine redis
      for stackoverflow is replicate of mysql in key-value for faster read and you
      can even add a caching layers on top of it but for real time it's a real challenge
      with FB Massanger you can't cache at all!
