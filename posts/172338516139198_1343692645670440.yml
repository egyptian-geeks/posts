      Can someone explain to me where the "negative" time difference exactly comes from? i.e. what happens to "time.now()" during the leap second.

      The way I understand it, so far, is that clocks are just "slowed down". So let's say time.now() returns 23:59:59.0, then 23:59:59.1 and so on until 23:59:59.9 and then 00:00:00 it will take 2 "real-life seconds", but it has still been perceived by the program as 1 normal, forward-moving second.

      What did I miss? Am I even making sense :) ?

    message: It is a subtle detail, but a programmer should be careful when using
      real and monotonic times. Real times should be used when displaying dates. Monotonic
      times should be used when calculating elapsed time. The first time a leap second
      was added to the Linux kernel (2012), it caused a huge mess. But it was handled
      smoothly the second time it was added (2015).

      RRDNS software, a number went negative when it should always have been, at worst,
      zero. A little later this negative value caused RRDNS to panic. This panic was
      caught using the recover feature of the Go language.
