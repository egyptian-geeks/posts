    message: There is value in the "common language for design". I have seen a benefit
      of it going to so many projects and either saying or hearing "we're just using
      bootstrap". It means the new developer feel like they know their way in the
      code without having to define a design guide for basic things.

    message: On the other hand, Bootstrap 4 is embracing the mixing use case and is
      going to make it more popular. That's a big part of their SASS-only migration.
