message: "Hello everyone,\n\nI am working on a small project in which I have to set
  up a docker container which carries nginx reverse proxy. The idea is that I want
  the connection to that container with https. However, as I am doing it locally on
  my machine I can't get certificates from the CA I am using. The CA is Let's Encrypt.
  I registered for a domain name with my public ip address on FreeDNS to overcome
  this issue but it didn't work and writing the domain name in the browser doesn't
  give anything with knowing that I am running xampp to test it. \n\nAny idea what
  should I do?"

      I am not sure what you want to do but you can Create a certificate using openssl and trust it from your machine.
      If I understand correctly running https://localhost is good for you ?
