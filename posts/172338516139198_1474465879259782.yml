      understanding), otherwise Hyper-V can definitely do the job.

      friend used hyper v, he told me it is very good,but he has Microsoft and windows
      server background so if you are coming from linux background vmware should be
      better option.

      VMWare is good for big environments but it will cost you more money

      The only two I used long enough to judge were VirtualBox and Parallels. But if I'm mistaken, the old wisdom used to be:

      - if it's a VM you need on for a long time without logging in to, HyperV

      - If it's a VM you often open to log in to and use interactively, then VMWare

      There is no comparison. Hyper-V should be compared to VMWare vSphere or ESXi.
      If you are comparing Hyper-V to VMWare Workstation, then the comparison is not fair.
      Hyper-v is for Servers, so it wont give great experience if you use if from a laptop for testing or development.
      VMWare workstation or even VirtualBox has better desktop experience in general. Better support for WiFi, etc
