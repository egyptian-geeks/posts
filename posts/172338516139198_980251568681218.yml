  I'm a RoR developer. I'm very satisfied with Ruby and RoR for web development. But I really like working/learning about algorithms and design patterns. And programming for non-web applications and solutions. Like embedded systems, security and other fields that i'm now aware of. So I want to know your opinion. Is transferring from web development to other fields is rewarding in regards to experience and salary ? I don't know exactly what fields use algorithms and other sophisticated programming concepts, I really enjoyed C++ a while ago. But I don't know if it's rewarding to learn C++ or should I just go with Java or other language ?

  (Note: So far I worked with PHP, Ruby. I have a little knowledge with Python. Tried .net two and half years ago, didn't go so well because of 70% of the egyptian market in .net was using web forms at that time)

  Thanks

      I worked on mobile apps, desktop apps & web apps, raspberry pi. C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, DDT, HTML, CSS, SQL, Mongo, Redis, SCSS, Dart, Bash, FTW, Batch files. Many buzzwords!

      And I'm not planning to stop! Really! I'm not joking. I love what I do. But let's be practical

      1- You can't learn everything in the world. You don't have the time or the energy. You also can't marry all the beautiful girls in the world. You must choose.

      2- In a full-time job, you can't control everything. You want to switch to a different kind of programming to apply algorithms, but this will not guarantee this. In web programming, we spend our lives trying to get the stupid JS to work. If you switch to embedded systems, you'll pull your hair because you have to implement your own string class, or chase el pointer ebn el *&$# which is causing your program to crash. If you switch to mobile programming, you'll start the emulator, then go meet this girl, fall in love with, get engaged, then married, she will get pregnant, and you'll have to leave her while she's giving birth because the emulator has finally finished loading! There is very little chance to apply algorithms in a full-time job.

      3- This is why there is a whole world of side projects, open source or not. You've the choice of technology, time, projects, algorithms, etc.

      4- When you finally decide to switch careers, then you can go to a company & say "See, I've experience & I made all of these embedded projects"

      So all the opinions here, is to do what I love and do side projects.
      Since I don't really know for sure what I love, I think I will have to do tons of side project to know ?
