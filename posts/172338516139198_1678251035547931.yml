    message: 'Just from the first page, I some issues, they talk about layered architecture
      and dependency injection, yet you have to write code to log vs using DI to inject
      the logger instead of using AOP. I would design a much simpler design with your
      core business for a single tenant. That is step 1. Step2: Add multitenancy the
      simplest way possible such as creating a separate schema for each tenant. When
      the number of users starts making sense, then you can do something more scalable.
      Otherwise, YAGNI will apply and you will be doing overkill. Anyone who mentions
      DDD and then uses Boilerplate logic like this is overcomplicating things. I
      would advise you to watch Uncle Bob''s clean Architecture video.'
