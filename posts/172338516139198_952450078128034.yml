      You will have to try an rpm based distro (like fedora) to know that they suck and go back to debian based distros :D

      Another taste of linux is gentoo, where you compile everything from source :)

      Check their forums for troubleshooting they are really helpful over there..

      Mosab Ahmad Rpm based distros truly suck..though i got really hitched to Opensuse for a while.

      I started really using linux on Slackware, I had trials before that with Madrake (now mandriva), knoppix, centos and OpenSuse, but Slackware was my first distor to stick more than a month on my computer.

      What I learned while using slackware was the foundation for my linux knowledge since :)

      But I got too old for dependency problems shit on rpm based distors :D

    message: Anyone tried both Ubuntu and Arch ? I would like to know how they compare,
      I'm always impressed Arch's wiki, it's so comprehensive and complete. I've always
      stuck to Ubuntu because of the support, any new (FOSS, free or even commercial)
      software project creates packages for Ubuntu and debian first, then they might
      (or might not) do for other distros.
