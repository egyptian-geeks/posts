    message: based on what has been said about agnular 4 at the first day of ng conf.
      angular 4 will be the most stable one and it will have LTS currently they will
      not introduce new feature anymore and they will work on issues and performance
      enhancements till the LTS

    message: Very stable. We have been building all new applications for the corporate
      accounts portal of a very large bank in Australia using it, with several apps
      built already, some in production, some migrated to Angular 4, all working very
      nicely.

      Although Angular itself is solid, I think the problem is in the continuous and fast changes. For someone who is trying to learn it, it's hard to catch up as things are always changing.
      I've been learning angular for a while, and the most thing I worry about is major changes like angularjs to angular2. And that's why I'm hesitant to move it to projects in production

    message: 'As far as I know that migration from Angular 2 to Angular 4 is very
      applicable, the changes are performance changes and some minor syntax changes
      (which replaces some deprecated features) .. Angular 2 / 4 are very stable ...
      the only issue from my point of view is that if you want to migrate from Angular
      JS (AKA : Angular 1)  to a totally new flavor of Angular.'

    message: The most up currently problem is that they frequently change the structure
      of their modules , renaming modules, and the hierarchy of angular modules and
      components, I think angular 4 will be the most stable version after that hassle
