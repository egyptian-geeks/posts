  I don't know whether this is a viable question or not, but i'll ask anyways.

  Is there any differences between Virtual Dom and Shadow Dom when it comes to SEO?

    message: "SEO has nothing todo with the topic...\n\n Virtual DOM is an object
      in the memory that libraries like React compare the new UI component with it
      then update the existing DOM ... \n\nShadow DOM is something else. When you
      create an element like a <select> the browser create sub nodes inside that select
      that you don't see unless you enable an option in the devtools (in Chrome at
      least). These sub-nodes doesn't contain any beneficial information for search
      engines.\n\nWas that clear?"
