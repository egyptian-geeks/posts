  Dear Linux geeks, does anyone know what it would take for me to take over a linux distribution that will be discontinued?

  Please help, it is my favourite distribution and I am literally in tears over this. I have not been this sad since someone died, in fact someone died and I was not this sad at all.

  Please help.

    message: funny this  "I have been doing this for almost 7 years  now and after
      all the bs some folks created for me I have decided to  stop development of
      remastersys and it will no longer be available. The  remastersys forum sections
      will stay up for a very short period of time  and then will be removed. I just
      have no desire to put up with it  anymore for a free software project. I've
      had enough and will no longer  be doing anything with development."

    message: Mohamed Salah I understand what you;re saying. Conky can be replicated.
      It's the scripts that I will need to download that do the configuring and the
      sources.list and i guess other stuff I don't know. It was just so much easier
      when other people did that for me. I asked the owner, and he said that they
      are discussing on how to move forward on the forums. For instance, on thing
      I would love to add to the world in an EMACS with the proper configuration for
      a Python dev environement with auto completion and a dark theme that you can
      just download and it works. EMACS has been very difficult for me, and I see
      I need to learn a lot to master it :)
