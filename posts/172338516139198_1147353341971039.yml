    message: system() exec() passthru() shell_exec() are always disabled on all shared
      hosting.. I'm pretty sure this is your problem... to make sure try to print
      the disabled functions, or ask the support..

      this might not be very relevant, but I once succeeded it running making an ASP.NET application run a java program on GoDaddy's shared hosting, I put a portable version of JRE over there and executed it and it worked!
      ... kind of, the JAR file was a Minecraft Server, it ran and I saw the console output (I redirected it), but their firewall prevented me from connecting to that server :D
