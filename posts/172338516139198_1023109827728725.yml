  Salam Alaikom, I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on Lenovo y50-70 preinstalled with Windows 8.1 With UEFI
  I followed this topic: http://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-windows-with-uefi?lq=1

  My USB (which is compatible to run and boot with UEFI) didn't boot with UEFI, although I disabled "Secure Boot" and "Fast Start-up". I decided to go with Legacy Boot and It managed to boot and I got Ubuntu menu setup. the colors and background were corrupted, Ignoring that I proceed with "installing Ubuntu", command window starts initializing setup files and It end with errors like this: http://i.imgur.com/fAnp1jz.png and machine didn't respond after that. After searching for what is "nouveau" .. I realized that there's a problem with my NVidia driver. Now if I run the installation again with parameter ACPI=off, do I risk my machine?

    message: Risk your machine as in risk hardware damage? No such thing. The worst
      that could happen is to corrupt your booting data and won't be able to boot
      before you fix it. Make sure your important data is backed up.

    message: Ahmed Al-Amir As I read, this parameter will disable crucial features
      like fans, which may cause my machine to overheat!

    message: Running with ACPI=off is usually harmless, as far as I know, I tried
      similar things before and I think I tried it too, but I think it's a bit of
      an overkill and isn't the best thing you can do, may be there's a better flag
      that would only have a smaller effect and still get things to work.
