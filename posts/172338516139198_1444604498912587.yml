      ال PHP أعلى من الجافا وعليه فهو أسهل في التعلم، وأيضا فهو أكثر إنتشارا من جافا.

    message: okay if you need to join the club then I suggest first is to search and
      see what the market needs you can first check job hiring sites like wuzzuf.com
      or bayt.com and other sites search using the major term for programming languages
      for example ( C#, Java, .net, PHP, python, javsscript) and collect data to see
      which language is more required in the job market, you can also seek Tiobe programming
      index which lists the most famous programming languages based on job descriptions
      and search queries, basically based o my humble experience JAVA, C#, Python
      and PHP has already good market and they are very good to learn if you target
      more stable company that existed for at least 8 to 10 years ago, if you want
      to work on start ups most probably you will find them working with javascript
      , ruby and python ( including node.js, react framework .. etc), and I suggest
      you focus on only one language and master it well, digest all the basic concepts
      and design ideas,  and after that play around with other languages and get a
      feelings for how things work in the other perspective, to give you a good starting
      point there are two major type of programming languages , static typed languages
      ( Java, C#,) which have many rules and outstanding IDE support (Eclipse, Visual
      studio) they are harder to learn because of how many rules you need to be aware
      of which will take a considerable amount of time, but it's time well invested
      because you will learn the basic ideas behind programming languages in general
      and get a good feeling regarding the major design principles that is applied
      today like Object oriented programming, and the other type is a dynamic type
      languages which include ( PHP, JavaSCript, Python) which do have much less rules
      regarding the syntax (language grammar) and much easier to learn, which is very
      good for jump starting and see real results of your work, but the down side
      it will be harder to learn the design principles and may influence bad programming
      practices in the long run, and might not be straightforward to debug and find
      bugs easy in this type of languages, lastly I would advice after learning one
      of the programming language invest your time also in learning algorithms and
      problem solving, design patterns too , which will greatly improve your thinkings
      and code quality, and will be a great help in your interview inside egypt or
      in europe, and for good books to start there is always the head first serise
      (head first java, head first javascript, head first design patterns.. etc) they
      are excellent books and very easy to digest for a new comer , wish you the best
      man :)
