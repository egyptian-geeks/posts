      At any point in time, there is only a limited number of elements. When you scroll, he destroys & recreate elements. If you check the number of rows using jQuery (like this $('.slick-row').length) you'll find it doesn't change.

      This technique is called 'virtual list' or 'virtual scroll'. It's also used in desktop applications displaying large number of items.

    message: It's called "virtual scrolling", which allows it to only render the visible
      parts. It's simple when you start, but gets complex with more realistic cases.

    message: While techniques like this are cool for working with lots of DOM on the
      page, but the real question should be "Why do you need to put so much DOM in
      the page?" EIther you are displaying to much, which goes against usability,
      or you are over complicating your design to the point it became absurd.
