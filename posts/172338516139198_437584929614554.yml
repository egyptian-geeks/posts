  Using chrome's own states method (About Memory tab) and with the same number/kind of tabs opened, chrome is eating 1.13 GB of RAM, and Firefox takes only 216 MB.
  I know, I've many extensions on chrome, but the sum of them all is around 320 MBs.

      Just because the extensions show their memory in task manager can't get you 100% confidence they are irrelevant.
      There could be a lot of things affecting this:
      - Side effects of loaded extensions in each of the pages
      - The obvious, amount of opened tabs
      - The less obvious, like amount of closed tabs
      - and also amount of history, bookmarks, and even cookies
      - Not to mention size of session-specific history (since browser we opened)
      - Does the memory include HTML5 local storage that maube some sites support in certain browser implementation but not another?
      - Do the sites include Flash? Is it sure to perform equally in both browsers?

      To have a fair comparison, you need to create a new user profile, and perform the same exact steps (including closing tabs or going from one page to another in same tab), without extensions or themes or anything.

    message: "Thank you Mohamed Meligy for this nice comment, I've already did a clean
      comparison between FF and chrome inside a fresh Windows 7 VM , both browsers
      with new installation with NO EXTENSTIONS at all,  and chrome still eats more
      ram than FF, see the results below:\n\nnew window (no tabs, just after a system
      restart): \nFF==> 102MB,\nChrome==> 168MB\n\nopen 10 tabs: \nFF==> 486MB\nChrome==>
      752MB\n\n5 minutes after closing the 10 tabs,\nFF==> 131MB\nchrome==> 196MB\n\nit's
      now clear enough to say that Chrome team has made a BIG mistake in recent versions
      that affects memory consumption, but I have no clue about what specifically
      is causing this.\n\nI love Chrome, but I'm now forced to get back to FF."

    message: I wouldn't worry about ~ 100 MB RAM difference, not in recent time machines.
      The other difference you refer to (the jump after 5 minutes) looks like a V8
      JavaScript VM thing to me. Looks like a lot of JavaScript objects or so that
      were later garbage collected. Maybe they have an issue though (which to me is
      sort-of acceptable). Might be worth bringing it to them.

    message: Firefox 12 and 13 have been doing great stuff recently as well anyway,
      but you know, Chrome is the new IE5/6. A lot of sites are optimized for pre-approved
      Chrome standard "proposals".

      I agree with you, except for the point of 100 MB.
      as you can see, it's not 100 MB, it's around 330mb+ with 10 tabs.
      and as you know, we (tech guys) surf usually with around 15 ~ 50 tabs opened, so expect a difference in GB scale, and this can't be acceptable from just a "Browser".

      as I said, I love Chrome, but I can't live with this issue no more.
      my machine has only 4 GB (Home & work), so this affects the overall performance of my machine too much.
      moving to Firefox, I now have enough to play with, taking into consideration that I've only 4 GB to play with.
      but when I was using Chrome, I convinced myself that I've only 3 GB or so, cause Chrome:The-king was reserving the rest for his majesty :)

      I was more talking about the after-5-min result. I usually run my machine with a client VM taking up to 6 GB of my total 10 GB RAM, and have Chrome open all the time on the host machine with many tabs. Rarely a problem.
      Are you using the final release channels of both or some pre-final equivalents?
