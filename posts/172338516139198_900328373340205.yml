    message: I'm not sure If you can access the digital data from the mic through
      the android API in realtime, then feed it back to the API during the call.

    message: I remember years ago that I wanted to encrypt the voice on Android, and
      the only way was to use VOIP. Basically the mic data goes to internally analog
      to digital converters, then thru the operating system's driver/API those digital
      data are then modulated to be transferred by the internal GSM Chips and then
      sent by the antenna.  Not sure if the latest Android API can give you access
      to that level.

      could i interrupt the process here  and make my changes on the digital converted
      data ?!'

    message: You can record your mic and there are software for that.. the problem
      is there is no API layer that can let you get your mic digital data and then
      use it while calling AFAIK. By API I mean something that talks with the driver
      layer.
