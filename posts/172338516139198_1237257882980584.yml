  I encountered something weird today. I opened Pintrest and I wasn't logged in. The browser prompt me to login with my account "Sign in with your account saved with Google Chrome". It isn't pintrest ... This isn't some DOM element with an overlay .. It's the browser. Like the native alert box! I don't know what is that. I decided to check incognito; the message showed up exactly with my email.
  Is that a new API? does anybody know what is this? This is purely a browser thing I have never seen before.
  I am using the dev-channel specifically 55.0.2859.0 (Official Build) dev-m (64-bit)
  I tried searching and found nothing. I will dig deeper into pinterest code but I don't have time for that.
  Clicking on Sign in or the email just close the box ... nothing happens. This is why I think it is something new and experimental.

      Yes. Chrome has a password manager (and it's separate from the usual sync stuff, and much newer, although it syncs with the rest of them), has had it for a bit but not sure in which channel because I switch between those.

      It usually shows you a dialogue to confirm saving passwords though. I'm surprised you didn't see that too.

      You can disable or enable from settings i think, or customise more from chrome://flags
