  Is that possible for the ISP to force opening Ads sites while browsing any web site?
  In Egypt, I have noticed that opening sites that I am regularly surfing outside Egypt without problems, redirects me for dozens of Ads sites and multiple annoying pop-up windows!
  Even I'm sometimes using AdBlockers or a trusted DNS!

    message: "Yes, Orange actually injects an Ad for its services and consumption
      alerts over the 4G connection I used to have in Egypt. \nNot sure if is is over
      HTTPS or HTTP only (it can inject on HTTPS by injecting itself in common items
      hosted in its nodes of CDN, so for example there might be a cache copy jQuery
      that is hosted by a global CDN and it has it’s local node in Orange servers,
      but that is on the technical side, most probably the CDN won’t accept that kind
      of local injection of scripts)."
