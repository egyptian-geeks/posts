message: "i almost never see a job in information technology in Egypt with salary
  range  , i understand the whole  \"you get paid based on what you can do\" concept
  but you as a company/start-up/project owner must have a range in mind when advertising
  for a job  , posting the range will just get you the right category of people you
  can afford .\n \ni also notice there are absolutely no standards to local freelancing
  prices  , i challenge someone to offer the same project to 5 different developers/designers
  and getting the same prices or even close  , this is not limited to freelancing
  but to registered software companies (well  , maybe the big names monitor themselves
  and other companies with the same sizes and try to keep the game close so you will
  see they offer almost the same salary packages and also the same products/services
  prices  ) .\n\ni see this in general is not good for the industry & open the door
  to lot of \"Fahlawa\" , i honestly have no idea how to price my coding service to
  anyone requesting it  , and asking for ranges from friends is almost pointless as
  each one see himself according to his previous payments and sometimes to this \"ego\"

    message: As long as the market is full with misinformed customers there will always
      be hustler companies trying to screw both developers and customers over their
      money and playing the man in the middle rule with no whatsoever added value
      where they achieve their margins by cutting it from both developrs salaries
      and the money invested by the customer..

    message: absolutely not  , i can always undermine your work by offering a "look"
      better product to your customers with lower price  , i can even highlight features
      in your product and convince him it is not essential  , and of course i can
      just reverse-engineer your product and sell it with lower price and claim i
      am the original (and customers don't care really ) , without rules everything
      is possible and survival to the meanest

    message: For the first question, I agree with what Fady said in the first comment.
      For the rest, i'm looking forward to apply what was said regarding finances
      in particular and freelancing in general from the Freelancer show podcast (
      http://devchat.tv/freelancers ) when I leave my current job to start freelancing.

    message: It's not only about that. It's mainly business. In big companies for
      example, you don't want to publish your numbers so your competitor would just
      pay a little bit more and be done with it. Plus, sometimes you could find someone
      very special that you are willing to pay much more than everyone else. If everyone
      else would know the range of his salary, it would create a lot of negative politics
      at the office between him and his teammates. There are a lot of reasons why
      top 500 never do that
