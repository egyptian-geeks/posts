message: "Hello Geeks \U0001F590\U0001F3FB\U0001F590\U0001F3FB\nNowadays most of the
  mobile apps are integrating with the most famous social media platforms (Facebook,
  Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn). For the developer, itâ€™s going to
  be a hassle to communicate with all of these platforms. So, I made an android library
  that makes this for you, with only one line of code, you can integrate with the
  most famous social media platform that are mentioned above.\nIf you liked the idea,
  star and share the library with the world :)\nand also any contributions are more
  than welcomed :D"
