  Guys i always had a question in mind.
  من وجودي هنا في الجروب و علي الفيسبوك، بلاقي ان فيه ناس كتير جدا علي درجه كويسه جدا من العلم، و بلاقي ايفنتس معموله بتتكلم عن مبادء advanced زي مثلا
  Rxjs, observables, functional programming etc..
  These events are sponsored by large Egyptian companies like wuzzuf.net etc.
  Yet when u check out these companies u find a very poor app!
  Question :- why is that?
  If they are sponsoring such events this mean they are aware of such technologies; then why they don't implement it them self?  Whats the excuse of a large scale webbased company to have a poor web?

    message: "I disagree with your evaluation of wuzzuf.net as a \"very poor app\"
      but let me go over a few points:\n1- Such events are meant to a) give back to
      the community b) get the best from the community i.e. recruiting. So if a new
      startup doesn't have the best talents, they would create an event just to gather
      new recruits. \n2- Unless UI/UX is significantly affecting usability and user
      retention, there is no ROI to revamping to a \"modern\" UI. Just look at forasna.com
      launched by wuzzuf.net. They can rebuild wuzzuf.net to look just as modern as
      forasna.com but it is just not worth it, and perhaps it may just confuse old
      users who are used to the old UI.\n3- They are probably busy working on backend
      features and maintaining the ever growing number of users. Revamping the UI
      just to make it look cooler is just a waste of time and money. Unless I find
      their app buggy or slow, I got nothing to complain, and it also shows what a
      good job they are doing managing the backend."

    message: Great story <3 thanks for sharing. To add to summary, although company
      is web based, ur main activities to grow up company is in the business side
      /internal. Your target was not to create best job search website, but to be
      top service provider. Tech dev. did not matter in ur business as much as business
      development...  I can relate.. Gona spend weekend digesting this concept!

    message: "Very reasonable question. I heard it like a 100+ times. I'll try to
      answer your Q since I'm an insider \U0001F642 Almost 50% of WUZZUF current (user
      facing functionality) code base is from 2010-13. Only 2-3 developers were working
      on the app for these 4 years. We were very understaffed and lacking resources
      and made many decisions sacrificing best practices from tech point of view in
      favor of delivering value to users. We had so many \"tech\" consultants telling
      us back then that we had to refactor all our code and that it was spaghetti
      and we would ultimately fail. We just ignored them and focused on DELIVERING
      VALUE to users. This strategy ended up working for us. Many years later, we
      are one of the largest and best funded startups in Egypt with 200+ employees,
      10k+ clients, and millions of users and still growing 2x every year. \n\nDuring
      the many years since our rebrand to WUZZUF in 2012, we focused our development
      focus on developing tools to optimize our internal operations so we can serve
      that many clients efficiently with a small team. We almost made zero user-visible
      product improvements in 2013/14 for that reason. \n\nWe only had resources to
      grow our development team again in 2015/16. Now, we have a team of ~20 software
      engineers but many of them only recently joined. We've been upgrading our tech
      stack from the ground up, revamping our UI, mobile responsive, etc... But it's
      taking longer than you would expect due to the tech debt. But if we didn't make
      these decisions years ago, we wouldn't be around, wouldn't be supporting with
      these events, and you wouldn't be asking this question \U0001F642 All our current
      upgrades and revamps are still in the kitchen and should be out very soon isA.
      So having achieved all this with spaghetti code and outdated UI, we're pretty
      excited about our next phase with an upgraded platform. \n\nTo sum up: \n(1)
      prioritization is one of business biggest decisions. Back then it was all about
      reaching a product-market fit regardless of tech. Now, as we scale, tech priority
      is much higher. \n(2) the bigger your operations and user flow, the more care
      and time it takes to revamp especially if you're cleaning up everything from
      the ground up. It's like rebuilding a 100 story building with people living
      inside. \n(3) tech businesses are not all about tech. It's about business as
      well :)  Clean code doesn't make a business succeed. Solving user problems and
      delivering value does. \n\nThanks for asking the question.\n\nP.S. We're currently
      hiring back-end software engineers as we are revamping WUZZUF from the ground
      up. At our scale, it's a very challenging and exciting journey helping connect
      people with jobs. If you have questions about this part or our new back-end
      tech stack, reach out to Sherif Medhat"

    message: I'd like to add to what Ameer said, the fact that there are great technologies
      in the world doesn't mean a tech startup needs to use all of them. The reason
      behind the existence of a tech startup is not to use technology, it is to solve
      a problem for a certain group of people (customers) in a specific market. Job
      seekers don't come to Wuzzuf because they want to use a ReactJS website, they
      come to Wuzzuf because they are looking for a job. When any startup is making
      technology decisions (especially in the early days) the main objective is how
      can they provide value to their customers as fast as possible using the current
      resources they have access to (which are always very limited). Technology is
      a means to an end, it is not the goal. This is a point that some early stage
      developers don't think of deeply enough due to their fascination with the "latest"
      technology, but its crucial to understand that technology serves business and
      not the other way around.

    message: "Without finger pointing to specific startups, we have real problems
      as a community here in Egypt :\n\n1. Lack of good calibers (experienced and
      hard workers ppl) , we talk a lot about technologies, refactoring, best practices,
      and so on so forth, but when it comes to get things done you will be shocked
      of the technical weakness, time wasted and poor output.\n\n2. Software services
      was dominating tech industry here in Egypt for decades, developers learned by
      practicing that they should deliver on time with least quality of code, to make
      the client sign off and the project is done. Nobody cares about maintenance
      as it will be a separate bill with different team.\n\n3. Product Management
      is a new profession here in Egypt, we don't have enough experience to manage
      product development, build product cohort matrixes and give a room for innovation
      at the same time. \n\n4. The Hiring War, as I call it. We have an endless war
      between startups on technical professionals, which is good for developers but
      we hurt ourselves in direct and indirect ways. I think it would be better for
      us if we work together to increase the number of good developers, rather than
      this endless money fight down the road."
