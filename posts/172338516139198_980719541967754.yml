      I have no experience with consoles, and thankfully others have chimed in with useful info. I just want to stress the point of physical activity.

      IMHO, It is good for kids of young age to interact with modern technology, and in my experience it helps bring up their talents, but physical activity is of utmost importance. Child obesity and withdrawal from human interaction are very possible and very dangerous issues.

    message: Don't get Wii at this stage there will be no new titles/games for Nintendo
      not a good invest for future, Xbox 360 will be a bit old, Xbox one supports
      new games  and older games 360 games

      any new games. I suggest Xbox with kinect, much better and has more games (especially
      ones that make them move more than Wi)

      When my father got me a wii few years ago, it was for about 3,000 egp. Today, you won't find new ones (speaking about the Xbox 360, not the new One), but they should be around 2,000. A quick search on dubizzle got me one ad of a modded Xbox 360 with 2 controllers and a 300GB hard disk of games and 13 CDs for 1,700. If the ad is true, I find this a good deal.

      (but personally, I don't think the differences between both versions are worth)
