  Dear Geeks,

  I have decided to never pay any money for software ever again, I made this decision 3 years ago and so far have not paid a single pence or even paid any subscriptions to any service. All software I use is free software and I have nothing cracked.

  I have also not paid for any music whatsoever, and am looking for a way to get books totally free. I currently have no trouble getting the information I need and only once 4 years ago paid for a book online.

  What do you think of trying a simialr experiment? Please tell me your experiences/opinions.

  BR,
  MSAMY

  A free geek :) A Sufi Geek :)

    message: Mohamed Elsherif both actually, free software is free from corporate
      control and free to distribute and use. Not paying money means we won't support
      this patent/copyright crap which to me is like a thug taking part of the street
      and charging you for parking.  You should only pay as a donation. If someone
      wants me to pay money it means I have a choice to do it. I don't think we really
      need to pay money for software any more. We could pay for services, for processing
      power, for experience. But closed proprietary code is now worth 0 to me, unless
      I need it to make money, and at that time I will charge the customer for the
      software they need to pay for,

      I don't agree that you should pay for software ONLY as a Donation, this doesn't make sense at all.
      and believe me you are paying for software one way or another, as a matter of fact you are already paying Facebook \ Google \ YouTube ... etc the fact that these services are still running means that you are paying.

      Everything you ever want can be found free, even of you can't write that level
      or langiage you could find it on Github. Browsers are free and material is available
      to learn. I Haven't found a single App on my Android I need to pay for. So what

      As for not paying, the goal is to save as much money as you can and to focus
      on being free of companies. SAAS is great, if you can get free accounts it is
      great.

      If the goal is not money itself, what's is it? Free in FOSS means freedom with all its degrees;  not zero cost software - their value is openness not saving. .

      of you can spend less and wisely and consume less or reach even the same conveince
      for less. For example, if you buy a Gtide chinese phone for 800 LE and get the
      same features as an iPhone if not more, then why not? You can get free electricity
      if you use solar energy, in Egypt we have a lot of that. You can get a free
      holiday or next to free, if you learn to camp. I like the idea of going off
      the grid, my dream is to have a home in the desert and work remotely and live
      off the grid :)

      I don't expect everyone to agree. What I am talking about is making a free choice not to pay for software until you must absolutely have to. And if you have a problem you cannot solve for free, write your own program and make it free and open source, that way you too give back to the community.

      Software is a form of knowledge currency and it makes sense to give back in the same currency.

      I think in the end if you share your knoweldge Allah will reward you and it doesn't make sense to ask people for money for an idea because all ideas and knowledge come from Allah. None of us know or understand really.

      if all prices go down, you will pay less, but you will also earn less, so it makes no difference at all, on a national level the value of the currency or how expensive things are is completely irrelevant.
      The complexity (and unfairness maybe?) comes when you look on the international level and consider exchange rates between currencies.
