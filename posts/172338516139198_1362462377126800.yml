    message: if it's really big and you care about scaling then java with jhipster
      generator, it's on top of spring boot and gives you everything in the 9 points
      and more .. like angular for the ui, performance testing, ui and unit testing..
      microservice for better scaling and maintainability .. ready gateway application
      to monitor your services.. docker integration for easier deployments..

    message: Why being 'object oriented' is a requirement for the language you are
      looking for? Go matches all of your requirements except the object oriented
      part. It's not truly an OO language with the concepts we are used to in java
      for example (https://golang.org/doc/faq#Is_Go_an_object-oriented_language).

      1. NodeJs: My personal favorite. I use the MEAN stack. It's really fun (and a bit messy) to write everything in Javascript. However, you'll do great if you know what you're doing.
      2. Ruby on Rails: Very powerful framework which boosts your work alot. It does almost everything for you. However, this might not be the case in bigger projects. Rails doesn't allow you to  organize your code in your own way, which I don't like personally.
      3.python: Powerful with a strong community. I don't have much experience in python web development, but I belive it's powerful enough to do anything.
      4.GO: They say it's fun. However, I don't think the community is as big as of python,node.
