  seeking entity as the good guys, something I was guilty of at some point.

    message: At the same time, it's totally unpractical to ask any management to establish
      a utopia company. Any human-based system will have it's flaws. Only God's creation
      is bug-free.

      I believe the story has other sides as well. Please read Reddit & HN comments

    message: Good thing to get the other side of the story. I still insist on my original
      comment about corporates, there are no "good guys" there. In the case of Google
      for example, lots of people tend to think of them as some kind of a fairy that
      distributes free services.

    message: Well, I agree with you from both the perspective of a developer and a
      consumer, they are definitely better than others. My point is that there is
      no such thing as a free lunch. They (and others) are not a charity.

    message: Of course they are a corporate & making money is their goal. However,
      her story has many holes. Why she's the only one who got punished? Why she didn't
      escalate the case - or even sue the company - it if it's illegal? Related to
      peer bonuses, you get them when you do something more than your assigned work
      goals, e.g. helping a colleague solve a bug. The sheet was nice, but it's not
      useful to the company. If I was her manager, I would reject the peer bonus as
      well (if it happened in the first place!)

    message: Doing business is not evil. Nobody said that they are running the company
      for charity. And everybody does business for their own interest even Entrepreneurs
      and freelancers. But just because they are still small, nobody considers them
      as evil. But after all, we are all doing it for money.

    message: I love what she did, and I was in the exact same situation one day at
      a company that has now become defunct (or close to it), the issue is that equal
      pay is a moral obligation, and what many people don't understand about capitalism
      and the market, is that employees have power in numbers too, I believe she could
      sue them if she gets the right lawyer (like an American Mortada Mansour  who
      can pull out enough CDs to get her a free salary for life :) ). Besides that,
      if Employees create a union like I've been asking for a long time, they would
      actually be able to shake down management into acting ethically. "Business"
      is not a synonym for "Immorality" :) , in a place where the rule of law is the
      case, the law should be fair and it should be applied. Every system will have
      a hole, in that case the management are obligated to take reasonable steps to
      accommodate, this is even done in public sector companies in Egypt btw :). Had
      this been a racial, gender issue, the PC vampires would have just shone their
      fangs and the management and they would have immediately complied :)
