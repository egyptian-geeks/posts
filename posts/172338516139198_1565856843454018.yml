message: I want to make a Payoneer account to get my freelance payment. I want the
  amount to stay in USD. Should I use Debit card or money transfer to my local bank?
  Any hints?

    message: AFAIK, In order to make your money stay in USD, your account must be
      in USD. If your account is in LE, you cannot make it stay in USD in both ways
      Debit card or a money transfer to your local bank. The money will be converted
      to LE using the conversion rate of your bank.
