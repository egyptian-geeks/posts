    message: "It's the same approach as atom electron. Performance is worse than existing
      desktop frameworks.\n\nIf you're talking about this approach being a mess (3akk),
      all desktop frameworks are more or less in the same situation (Tk, GTK, Qt,
      etc). In other words, \nكلهم لامؤاخذة شمال!"

    message: Mohamed Samy It's a good start, but it has very limited set of widgets.
      All extensions are incompatible with each other. You need to know Tcl to do
      anything advanced. Not integrated well with the OS (minimize to tray, handle
      Windows events, etc).
