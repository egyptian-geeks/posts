  A massive trove of Microsoft's internal Windows operating system builds and chunks of its core source code have leaked online.

  The data – some 32TB of installation images and software blueprints that compress down to 8TB – were uploaded to betaarchive.com, the latest load of files provided just earlier this week. It is believed the data has been exfiltrated from Microsoft's in-house systems since around March.

  The leaked code is Microsoft's Shared Source Kit: according to people who have seen its contents, it includes the source to the base Windows 10 hardware drivers plus Redmond's PnP code, its USB and Wi-Fi stacks, its storage drivers, and ARM-specific OneCore kernel code.

    message: I'm guessing this will be the only way I can be convinced to use windows
      10. Hopefully someone will audit the code and strip out the telemetry and spy
      bullshit and release a decent build for privacy conscious users.
