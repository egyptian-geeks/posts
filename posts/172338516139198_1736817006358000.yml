    message: FTP is like HTTP, it sends data in clear text and unencrypted. For your
      own data security, not just for the provider, you should avoid using it and
      only use SFTP. Actually, if someone is forcing you to use FTP only, you should
      avoid dealing with them for your own good.

    message: 'So the question would be: What secure cloud services that provide SFTP?
      (I hope with zero knowledge from the service provider).'
