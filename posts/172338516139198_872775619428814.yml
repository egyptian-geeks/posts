    message: Also, imagine if you are adding a specific action to an HTML tag, if
      you are using obtrusive js you will have to repeat the function and update it
      in all occurring instances. However if you are using unobtrusive js you will
      add the even to all tag with a specific tag and modify/upfate the function in
      on place.

      a clean code.\n\nLet's say you have this example:\n\n<a href=\"javascript:window.open('http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript')\">W3C
      Article</a> \n\nand you use many of it in all your application and you application
      grow and grow and this piece of code grow as well. imagine the headache of going
      throw all your code and adding a class like 'js-newwindow' and cleaning all
      your code and test it. so why not taking 5 min planning before you write this
      code and make it abstract and clean.\n\n- Donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle
      of software development: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\n\nNeed

      Alright :) Let me explain to you:

      jquery-ujs wires event handlers to eligible DOM elements to provide enhanced functionality. In most cases, the eligible DOM elements are identified by HTML5 data attributes.

      So you must have seen something like this:
      <%= form_for item, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>

      jquery-ujs attaches a handler to links or forms with the data-confirm attribute that displays a JavaScript confirmation dialog. The user can choose to proceed with or cancel the action.

      This is a very good article explains how jquery-ujs: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tour-of-rails-jquery-ujs
