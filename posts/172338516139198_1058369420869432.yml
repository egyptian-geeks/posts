  "Proud" to say that this article confirms what I predicted almost 5 years ago when I first started learning about #linux

  Before that day, I would have considered this all blasphemy, even though I had read "The Cathedral and the Bazaar " back in 2000, I still could not see it until 2011.

  P.S. please before making any rash comments, read the article carefully and the articles linked by it.
