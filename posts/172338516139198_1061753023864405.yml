  Wonderful news, and about time. Now for a serious cross platform IDE, only Jetbrains is in a position to do that now :)

  So why now? Because we believe it is the right time due to several factors:

  We’ve been working for several years in allowing ReSharper to work in different environments, independently of Visual Studio. An example of this is dotPeek.
  It’s quite clear that there’s an ever increasing tendency of developers using non-Windows platforms, and we’d like to give them the same experience they’ve come to know and love with ReSharper.
  Finally, Microsoft moving its platform and C# language towards Open Source, along with initiatives such as CoreCLR, have been an added incentive.
