message: I have been working with CSS for nearly 13 years and this is the first time
  I see that pipe attribute selector. Interesting explanation between the difference
  between it and the caret selector and some real live examples.

    message: That's crazy! Even crazier, since it's pretty old (as old as all other
      attribute selector), the support (as MDN and CanIUse put them) seems to be dated
      to IE 7!

    message: It's actually CSS 2.1 ... even before the :lang selector (apparently
      it came to replace it) ... Before reading the examples I was like WTF why create
      a selector that selects what starts with characters plus the dash :D

    message: Yeah, I'd love to know the history of this. Maybe in the days when everything
      was in the CSS class. Not sure, but curious.

    message: "I think it provides a more generic way to target certain languages ...
      Like [lang|=\"en\"] here you don't have to worry about adding specific subset
      of the language -If I am allowed to call it so- e.g. en-GB, en-US ... etc. But
      again, that could be done using the caret selector so it's weird.\nI did a little
      bit of research and according to this document http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching
      ; pattern matching attribute selectors wasn't in CSS2 yet \nSo at this time
      neither the caret selector nor the psuedo selector \"lang\" was available ...
      If you wanted to target a specific language then you had to use [lang=\"en\"]
      and repeat it for every subset you are targeting. Then apparently the solution
      at this time was to come up with that weird pipe thing :D"
