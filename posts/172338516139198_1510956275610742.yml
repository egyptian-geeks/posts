      GraphQL gives way more flexibility and control over the way you query and structure data. It provides functions to query just the data you need. Their documentation is top notch too.

      It's the hottest thing right now. GitHub will be using it for their v4 API.

      Usually, when you want to change something in the front-end you would require some change on the back-end also
      You could want more data in the response of a certain request, or you don't need some of the response data anymore (so the server is serving unnecessary data, which mean unnecessary database calls)

      GraphQL solve that by letting the front-end just ask for what it needs, and the server will respond with these data

      So you basically talking to one end point, telling it what you need and it serving it to you, rather than talking to a lot of end points and requiring modify the code every time you need something more or less

      and this plays very well with reactjs nested components

      This video should you a very good explaination for how it works
