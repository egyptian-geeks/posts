      They did some writing already as a research (not emotive). And there was a video about how to control someone's hand using EEG signals (I dont remember the right name).
      And This is not reading, it's just mapping some waves pattern to a digital action (Although some researchers managed to record someone's dream)

      This device is an EEG headset that can sense your "brain waves" and send them
      wirelessly...
