      I use Logitech G602 wireless gaming mouse. It has 11 programmable controls and different profiles for each app. Since I use Eclipse everyday for Java development, I assigned some of the keys to perform the following keystrokes:
      1) Copy
      2) Paste
      3) ctrl + / -- to comment code
      4) ctrl + shift + Num+ -- to collapse code
      5) ctrl + shift + f -- format code
      6) Alt+Left Arrow -- back to previous code
      7) Delete
      8) Enter

      I don't understand why people split their HDD honestly ... It doesn't affect recovery, you don't lose anything when you don't, it is just a waste. Huge waste. 50GB isn't enough for Windows now with all the applications we are using. And one of your drives will always be full and you start adding stuff to the other in different places.
      I would like to point out that I have been using ONE partition since Windows 95 and I NEVER ran into troubles; I do know what I am talking about
