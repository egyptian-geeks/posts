  Have you ever made a phising website to hack someone ?
  if so ... was it really convincing ? and could catch your victim ?

      back ago the back then popular social website hi5 had a security vulnerability which is that you could post flash files to people's profiles

      the funny thing is that you could run action script within these files

      so what I did is that I created a 1px by 1px flash file which contained code to redirect the visitor to my website

      and instantly I had the ability to lock down any profile I want

      I also copied hi5 login page to my website and made it do the submission to my database amd added this url to the flash file I created earlier

      so once you open someone's profile with my flash file in it you will be redirected to my hi5 login screen amd you naively enter your credentials

      then you would be redirected to hi5's homepage
