      back ago the back then popular social website hi5 had a security vulnerability which is that you could post flash files to people's profiles

      the funny thing is that you could run action script within these files

      so what I did is that I created a 1px by 1px flash file which contained code to redirect the visitor to my website

      and instantly I had the ability to lock down any profile I want

      I also copied hi5 login page to my website and made it do the submission to my database amd added this url to the flash file I created earlier

      so once you open someone's profile with my flash file in it you will be redirected to my hi5 login screen amd you naively enter your credentials

      then you would be redirected to hi5's homepage

      After first finding out about HTML and view page source, I copied the website of the game I was playing at the time and changed the form to point to a php script I wrote. First time writing the password gave back a page with "Your account/password is wrong" and the form pointing to the original website again. That way the person thought he just wrote the password wrong first time and ignores it. I told some guys about the website, because many people playing the game in internet cafes needed help with opening a web browser and getting to the account management pages. My guys then offered help and wrote my website instead. :D

      Had I known about javascript or cURL and the hosts file, it could have been so much more effective. ^^
