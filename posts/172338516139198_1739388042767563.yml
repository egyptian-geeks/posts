  Does anyone have any experience with development with MacBook Air ? And is it better or normal laptop with corei7 processor ?

  I did some search and watch videos on youtube they said that it's good for normal and not heavy programming staff, I am not sure it will be fast for vagrant images or not

  can anyone share his experience ?

      Totally fine as long as u do some basic web development. The gpu is the problem so if your work doesn't rely on a good gpu you'll be just fine.
      One thing worth mentioning is ios/storyboard loading thing might be slow a bit, but you will be able to do almost everything you want.
      i5 or i7 is okey but you need 8GB of rams

      budget you can custom (prefer not directly buying) a cutting edge laptop.

      You should consider which i7 or i5.
      Mac in general is overpriced.
      For example for the less than the price of a Mac air you can get "gaming" laptop. They usually have HQ processors (quad core / 8 threads) plus a decent GPU, ssd +HDD.

      macbook air is totally fine for development. Just make sure it is 8gb ram
      However, I was researching recebtly and found out that its price is close to a macbook pro baseline, which has newer hardware and better screen.

    message: Assuming you want Macbook Air because you want a lightweght laptop. I
      reccomend going for a DELL Inspiron 13 inch with 32 GB RAM, with i7 M or greater
      (more cores). The OS you could use would be a Linux Ubuntu variant which is
      more frugal with your RAM and you can set up VirtualBox VMs for development
      environments of choice. 8 GB Ram is what I would use for my phone, a dev machine
      should be at least 16 GB in my opinion. So I favour 1. Processor cores count
      , 2. RAM, 3. SSD over having a MAC
