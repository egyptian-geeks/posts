      You are committing from an account which has different email than the primary one.

      adjust the account data, check this to know how:
      https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/

      " is there any way to restore them back to my account ?"
      Once you changed the email, all your upcoming commits will not appear as unknown, for the previous ones, yeah, you still can fix this.
      add the email from which you made the last commits to your emails on github, from here:
      https://github.com/settings/emails
