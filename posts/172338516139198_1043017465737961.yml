      To follow news: I listen to Podcasts (can list them in a separate post), I listen to them while commuting (fel microbus aw fel metro, that is why I hate to drive). Many podcasters summarize what happened in the last month in Javascript or news from Google, etc.
      For learning I use Pluralsight, then books, then blog posts.
