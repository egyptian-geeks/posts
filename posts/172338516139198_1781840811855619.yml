      What do you want out of your career? If you can have any position as a first job, what and where would it be? Then we can optimize for it. And why? Is it because you think it will get you maximum money now, maximum money in 10 years, leaving Egypt, pivot to be a manager, pivot to be an architect etc.

      I mean the skillset needed to work as a presales engineer in Microsoft Egypt is vastly different than working as a backend engineer in a startup in Berlin, maslan. And the pros and cons are miles apart.
