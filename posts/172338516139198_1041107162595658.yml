      systems and operations, but nothing beats experience.

    message: "I can relate somewhat, I was a developer (in a remote team) and later
      I tool the responsibility of maintaining some infrastructure and our Dev/Test
      ESXi servers. This is not DevOps in the ultimate sense but it was the closest
      you can get in this company.\n\nThere were some Pros:\n=================\n-
      you look at your code very differently when you deploy it. you start thinking
      differently about TDD and CI and CD. \n- For some reason, developers (Windows
      Developers) are not big on automation, it is not baked in their nature like
      those of Linux background. Handling some Ops, activates this part in your brain.\n-
      You understand your product much better.\n- if you have influence in the Dev
      Dept. and you take some Ops responsibility, you get leverage in 2 departments.
      Which gives you more influence in the company decisions, something that you
      rarely get being just a developer, especially as the company grows larger.\n\nAnd
      some Cons:\n=============\n- To the Dev team, you become the friendly IT Guy.
      You get swamped fighting fire. and you get less time to code and finish your
      actual development tasks.\n- Some people have the culture of (if someone else
      knows it, I don't have to), so if you try to teach your fellow developers some
      Ops skills, you get lots of resistance\n- If you don't get some power over the
      infrastructure (decision making power) then it is just a burden.\n- Doing anything
      without proper education, hurts. There is a saying (Knows just enough to be
      dangerous), You may think you know enough, but you are actually ignorant and
      you don't even know what you don't know :)"

      That being said, I believe every developer should do some IT/Operations, and Customer Support. If they don't, they are just code monkeys.
      Nurses give you shots, but still a doctor must learn how to do it.
