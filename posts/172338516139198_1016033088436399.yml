      What is your definition of 'heavy traffic'?

    message: "The main idea in most of these topics is to plan ahead, you can't turn
      a non-scalable App into a scalable one easily, also you can't do a scalable
      service easily if it is stateful (stores the states of sessions in the server-side)
      unless you use a shared persistence component (which itself needs scalability
      and affects the design and architecture greatly).\nAlso utilizing a continuous
      delivery system (like Jenkins) and a configuration management tool (like chef,
      puppet or Ansible) will get you the rapid deployment model you need to support
      a heavy-load frequently changed system.\nA very important topic here is to monitor
      and baseline you App performance, without this monitoring, you will not understand
      how your App is doing and when to intervene to support your App availability.
      \nI suggest you read about the AutoScaling/Elastic load balancing services in
      AWS, or Cloud Maestro if working in other cloud service, it will show you a
      good example about elastic architectures and how to design them."

    message: Ahmad Hisham thanks for reply first, I'd like to know what's your recommendation
      for decision to make the app scalable from beginning or not and then work on
      scaling it ... and what is the best stack to achieve robust scalable secured
      web application with cost effectiveness on the long term

      My experience involves Ruby on Rails and Java, but I believe most modern languages can give you a very scalable App if it is designed appropriately (personally l'd recommend NodeJS because of it's speed and Asynchronous IO model).
      The first rule is to keep your App stateless (keep your API calls atomic, send any needed details in your request to the App, and keep the session data in the client-side).
      What I've learned is try to keep your App in shared-nothing model as much as possible, don't try to share any flags/locks/non-concurrent storage, keep your persistence layer completely separate from your App (and don't take SQL as the only storage model, many NoSQL databases are much more usable in many cases).
