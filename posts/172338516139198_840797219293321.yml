      Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know this is a personal enterprise where one admin is free to set a rule only to contradict it next day. The group's policy is clear about this, it's also clear about double standards.

      As administrators we're expected to uphold community ethics Adel.

      I've given this enough time to resolve itself out of respect to my fellow administrators and Mohamed Alaa, this behavior is unacceptable and I will not tolerate double standards in this group nor will I go along with it.

      The previously pinned post by  Mohamed Meligy was a clear instructive message to not post job ads here. It kept these kind of shitty posts[1] from creeping up as often as they used to.

      Mohamed Alaa, kindly unpin this post and lead by example.

      The double standard here is granting one individual a privilege that was previously restricted to matters concerning the community. Like policy changes and new regulations.

      I don't mind moving this forward into something regular that would shed light on some of our member's accomplishments as a form of an earned reward. Do highlight earned.

      However, If every individual by extension to their administrative state, earns the right to utilize the group to their own personal benefit then what exactly are we doing here talking big words like "community" and "policies"?

      I totally agree with Hady and Ahmad and a good rule would be for members to ask admins if they wanted something to be pinned and the admin would judge that, and if one of the admins wants to pin something he should ask another admin not doing it himself.

      But as you guys mentioned we need to move this forward and support other members if they wanted to do something similar.

      pr  product. What double standards you are talking about!\n\nPersonal benefits!
      You are talking as if we stealing money of people and running outside the country
      :D \n\nlet me assure you that there is no benefit of making this app and neither
      there is any plan for ROI or to charge people. The Idea is an Experiment to
      document and to make a Hangout discussing the goal of the Idea and comparing
      it with other ideas. So the benefits and the personal accomplishments are for
      the community.\n\nOne last thing because also last time I didn't like how everyone
      start to attack admins in a case to one of the Admins. Try to send the person
      a Private Message and if he doesn't respond or if he ignore it you can escalate
      the issue but don't escalate an issue without even talking directly with the
      other party.\n\nI didn't get any request from any member to pin anything and
      I refused it and didn't see any of the admin refused anything. This group is
      for educational propose and for networking and getting to see new Ideas and
      to learn more. And we have many rules protecting this policy and we welcome
      suggestions By the way. so at the end we don't seek our \"Personal benefits\"
      .\n\nI Removed the Pin from the Post not because of you wrote. but because the
      experiment proves what I needed to know. Thanks for all who Votes and All who
      shared the Post."
