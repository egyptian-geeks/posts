    message: In fact it is funny because when I was trying to comment on the post
      I was just about to say this is the first time I have seen Egyptians taking
      positive action, usually they take the side of the aggressor or they tell the
      person who has rights that it is the way he asked for the rights that stopped
      him from getting his rights, I was commending the people in the post for taking
      positive action and here come the Admins and take the ultimate negative action.
      No wonder we never get anywhere in this country!

      fraud reports. We are very strict with the Group rules to make sure the quality
      we are seeking is achieved. There are many ways to report this issues but unfortunately
      our group is not that place.

    message: I just happened to find something similar on stackexchange and the question
      wasn't closed, although they have stricter rules than this group. I think we
      shouldn't deny the posting, but I agree to delete any abusive comments http://serverfault.com/questions/293217/our-security-auditor-is-an-idiot-how-do-i-give-him-the-information-he-wants
