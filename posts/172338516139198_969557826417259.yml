  After 4 attempts, the final being upgrading  Virtualbox to the most recent version, I guess things are not looking good for Windows 10, the OS that is supposed to run on many devices.

  Of course this is not just a Windows bashing post, so anyone who knows how to get this to work, please enlighten me with your abundant knowledge :)

      maybe Windows 10 boots differently, and thus you might need a future version of Virtualbox.
      Or maybe Windows 10 has a few bugs that relate to virtualization that are yet to be fixed.

      Well a VM isn't really a device, it's more like a trick :D
      But anyways, I think it has happened before where VM software needed an update to support a certain OS, I remember Parallels on Mac needed an update to support Windows 8, so this isn't a new thing.

      long ago was ease of use and compatibility, now that that is gone, I don't expect
      a bright future for Windows 10. In fact, I make a bold prediction that the next

      I can't believe you're actually comparing OSes based on how well they work on a simple VM like VirtualBox (not even a powerful one like VMWare or HyperV). *epic facepalm*

      VMWare or HyperV are "more powerful", I highly recommend you read about Vagrant.

    message: 'To get back to the teach issues Mohamed Meligy Article 1 is about Debian
      as the gues OS with Windows 10 as the host, which is not the case here.  Quoting
      article 2: “The Program Services include experimental and early prerelease software.
      This means that you may experience occasional crashes and in rare cases data
      loss. To recover, you may have to reinstall your applications, the operating
      system, or re-flash your device. Using the Program Services on some devices
      may impact your  warranty (check with your device provider). By participating,
      you agree to frequently backup your data.”  The ideao  I wanted to highlight
      is that an OS promising so much SHOULD IMHO be more stable from the get go,
      these kinds of statements by MS show to me that their development methodology
      has not changed much, which in my opinion is a mistake, I seriously believe
      they need to take pointers from the Linux world as they are doing today and
      as someone like Nadella is applying. When Hassan Aly Selim replied he was more
      interested in defending MS than in answering that point or discussing it which
      I call the old "Ballmer" approach. The deeper meaning behing the post is that
      the paradigm has changed and is changing, will MS dev teams be able to  keep
      up with the changes happening in this world or not? Another point I found funny
      was saying the Virtualbox was a weak virtualization technology as opposed to
      VMWare or Hyper-V , I find such a statement unqualified and not even scientific,
      maybe it was a reference to some client features, but Virtualbox goes far beyond
      that, especially coupled with a technology like Vagrant.  So the main idea which
      I guess many don''t get is that the software that is being released now and
      the services are coming in a very delicate time in IT history and MS needs to
      step thingss up if they want to even keep part of their relevance for the future
      decade.'

      recommend you read about Vagrant. \n\nDid you read about it? Because you sound
      pretty clueless there with your since-the-90s-windows-experience and the first-dpkg-package-of-glory.\n\nThis
      post is intended to incite a flamewar not solve a problem. So time to put a
      leash on it... I'm keeping it for the kindness that Meligy showed in presenting
      solid technical insights instead of shunning it. If this thread drifts again,
      it'll be removed.\n\nLet this also be a fair warning, this group is not a place
      to have a flamewar. There's another place for that, they call it IRC. Yeah...
      It's still running. \nFlamewar inciting posts will be removed without warning.\n\nThanks."

    message: Hady Ahmad Actually what you are saying is the start of a flame war and
      you are being rude and insulting "Did you read about it? Because you sound pretty
      clueless there with your since-the-90s-windows-experience and the first-dpkg-package-of-glory."
      This was a very childish way of answering. At least if you try to interfere
      in a decent conversation do so with maturity. Mohamed Meligy Mohammad Tayseer
      I don't know how you guys pick admins, but at least have a policy that they
      need to take a more mature approach to conversations.

      After 4 attempts, the final being upgrading  Virtualbox to the most recent version, I guess things are not looking good for Windows 10, the OS that is supposed to run on many devices.

      Of course this is not just a Windows bashing post, so anyone who knows how to get this to work, please enlighten me with your abundant knowledge :)
