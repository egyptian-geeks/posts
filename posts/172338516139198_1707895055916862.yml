message: "Does anyone know where I can buy Alfa AWUS036NHA here in Cairo? I just generally
  want a USB Wifi Adapter that has an Atheros chipset, and I checked another option
  which is the TP-LINK TL-WN722N, but I am not sure that the one sold in Egypt is
  version 1 or 2, does anyone have experience in this? \n- A noob who is trying to

    message: Tried to search for it , all the adapters in egypt are fake , and if
      you buy it from outside of egypt customs will reject it and then U will have
      to re-export it again , your only hope to buy one is to have someone outside
      of egypt who can buy it for you , and for me I'm using TL-WN722N , works fine
      but has a very low range

    message: Hey guys, I found the TL-WN722N version 1.1 with the Atheros chipset
      el 7amdolelah at souq el 3asr, not all the stores have the first version, though.
