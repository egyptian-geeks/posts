    message: From this, I would say B2B. They provide big events/organizers with a
      service to manage their event schedule for the attendees through the app.

    message: Just know that Meetup's story and how much it was struggling to monetize
      its business. Meetup ended to charge the event organizers and put a strict curation
      rules to guarantee the quality of the platform. I understand that many businesses
      want to capitalize Millennials who are mostly would spend more on got experiences
      through events and travel, because they are mostly can't afford to own properties
      or assets. But, I don't really know how sustainable eventtus business model
      is ?!

      2. percentage from all the sold ticket through the website.

    message: this app specifically power came from the support of their investors
      .. vodafone .. using vodafone cash as one of their payment methods make make
      them rock stars against ticketmarch for example .. this is all happens before
      the evolution of fawry and payfort off course .. according to numbers and current
      state of the startup it should be good as they opened recently a new market
      at dubai
