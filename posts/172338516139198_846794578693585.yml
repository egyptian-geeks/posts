  good post. However, I disagree with the post's author over "vanillaJS for everything". In my opinion, using Plain JavaScript to build my own (non-functional) stuff  while there are good alternatives built and proven by the community is just not feasible practically taking into account multi-team multi-project company. Any way I will end up building my own framework to get what I am getting now from the existing frameworks with less support and capabilities.
  I prefer to contribute with others/community to a framework we believe in in order to make it better rather than everyone/team/company building their own one.
