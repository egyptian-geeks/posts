    message: Ahmad Alfy I was just thinking of peeking at his solution, but I decided
      not to for I might give it a try later. I don't think this is a problem to resolve
      in an hour.

      very nice, I'm into coding challenges, I have just solved number 5 but I don't want to check his solution now, are there are only 5 combinations summing up to 100 ?

      OK, ignore that, I checked, they're 11, found a small bug in my code, thanks anyway :)

      start trickling in really quick. What bothers me is that several applicants
      will invariably have no idea of what "programming" means.
