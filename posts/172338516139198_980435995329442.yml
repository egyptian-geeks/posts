    message: Not fair :) I think the patents should last for sometime not for ever,
      but it's existence is mandatory especially if you have a small company.

    message: Anyway, read the article, I think that more innovation will come when
      we are all free to innovate. I also believe that our ideas are not our own,
      but that is a long philosophical discussion

    message: Let's imagine this scenario :) you've a small company and you had an
      idea and you start working on it and once you published a product or a service
      a very big company like MS or Google developed a similar product and for sure
      big companies have a better marketing and a better technical implementation
      team, the result will be everyone is using the famous better implemented one
      rather than the real one (Imagine years of effort by your side) :)

    message: Nice scenario, but take for example the Linux Kernel and the Gnu OS,
      it was more stable and better performing than Windows, and I can argue that
      it still is, yet MS does not copy it because it is bound by the license. The
      idea behind free software is that those that copy it, cannot sell the actual
      product for money, they can only sell the support and their code must be open
      for all to see :)

    message: So you write a great app under the GNU public license, I take the app,
      refine it, make it better, but I cannot close source it, I must make it freely
      available for all people, including you :) Free as in freedom not free beer

    message: I believe in openness but also everyone is free to decide whether he
      wants to open his software or not :) also I'm will never blame a company for
      thinking in a profitable way ;) one last think I learned a lot from the open
      source software and that's the main reason I support it but sometimes you need
      close your door to survive.

      Profitable is very good and also very important, but you can be profitable because you are creative, or because you provide better service. There are many companies that are making money off of free software. In fact the trend is for Open Source to take over and Shrink the market turning it into a services market...

      To make things clear, I am not talking about forcing openness, but I believe companies will do that anyway, as you can see from the market, as the price of software now trends to Zero :)
