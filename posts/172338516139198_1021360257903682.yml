      Looks like a XY problem*.
      What do you _really_ want to accomplish?

      Why not use a stock hotspot and have the Arduino or whatever connect to it and use the admin console (e.g. TELNET if available, or at worst use the HTTP administration page).

      You should really read about the XY Problem. The question might be clear but your intent and your details aren't.
