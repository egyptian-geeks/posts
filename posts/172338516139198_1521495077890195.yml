  A bit off topic discussion but worth mentioning. People always ask what is the best upgrade you can do to your laptop, and the recommendation is always SSD. I'm making this post to further support this recommendation. I upgraded my laptop (Lenovo Flex 3) with an SSD, and I wanted to upgrade my RAM as I currently have 8GB. I did a little benchmark and I can say that you do not need more RAM, and here's why.

  When the OS runs out of RAM, the default is that it starts writing to SWAP partition (Pagefile if Windows), which is what makes the computer terribly slow and you feel the hunger for RAM. Since SSDs have incredibly high read/write speeds, writing to SWAP/Pagefile is not an issue anymore.

  This was just a thought until I did a little benchmark. I am running Windows 10 and I have a Linux VM for development. I increased the RAM of the VM to 6 GB, I opened every application possible (Chrome, Firefox, SQL Developer, Sublime, Skype, OneNote, Outlook, Word, Excel, you name it). That wasn't enough so I launch 3 games all together (for those who are aware of gaming, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Warcraft III).

  I can safely tell you the laptop was running smoothly, the VM was performing flawlessly, I was switching between all the games, browsers, all apps and I didn't feel any slowness. Of course with this load on the processor, there could be a performance degradation because of the processor but the RAM was holding up fine.

  Short version: aim for SSD as soon as possible, and sorry for the long post.

  Edit: For clarification I am not saying to completely ignore RAM but you should prioritize SSD over RAM, and that the SSD will make your need for RAM less urgent.

      It's not recommended to use swap partition on SSD. The suggestion is always to disable this feature an buy more ram, as the swap partition will eat up your SSD's lifetime

      Definitely SSDs are so much better and faster, however, you need to follow best practices if you want it to stay alive for a while

      Swap will reduce the read/write lifetime of your ssd hard disk...
      Besides the swap process is cpu intensive by its own.
      You should disable it...

    message: Theoretically speaking RAM is for processing Hard Drive  is for storing;  you
      may find it is good enough for such cases you tested with, but the drawbacks
      will be very harmful,  the driver performance will decrease over and over ,
