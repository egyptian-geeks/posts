      I think that calling a script file from an element is not really a best practice.
      You should "only" include the javascript before/after the DOM is loaded.
      But you may try a jquery binding on page load.
      Or is there any special reason behind your approach?

    message: "To make it work you need to replace the <script> tag with a <span on<event>=\"foo();\">
      foo</span>. \n\nThat being said, inline scripts & putting everything in the
      global scope like this, is very bad & will cause lots of issue performance wise
      and maintainability wise. \n\nYou should have this function called by an external
      script. \n\nLike this. <span class=\"js-foo\"> foo</span> & then in your JS
      file you should attach the event on the element with class \"js-foo\"."

      I think you want to call your JS function when the user chooses that option. If that's the case then use Ahmed El Gabri's suggestion.

      But I don't think your HTML structure is correct. It looks like you want either a <select> with <option> tags or <a> tags on these options.
