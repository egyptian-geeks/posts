  Hey guys
  I'm a 2nd grade CS student and I'm interested in infosec now but the problem is i wasted this 2 years i'm not good at programming i can write code on some level but i'm feeling that i can't think in code and that's my bad because i didn't finish a book or a full course i depended on tutorials and some small tasks i didn't solve a lot f problems. so i'm worried now if its too late or i won't be able to catch up? so any advice?

      It's never too late..
      You need to:
      1. Start learning a structured programming language (Ex: C)
      2. Do a simple project in this language (Ex: Calculator using infix notation format). This will make you learn alot about data structures as well.
      3. Implement some basic data structures/algorithms in this language (Ex: Linked lists, stacks, trees, binary trees, graphs). This will make you understand these algorithms/data structures, as well as improving your skills in this particular language, and in programming in general.
      4. Try some compettitive programming (Ex: codeforces.com). This will make you think more in code, and think of some innovative solutions for some complex problems.
