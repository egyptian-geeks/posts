      Not entirely sure the scope of reactive programming that you want. You should watch every RxJS thing on YouTube, especially the ones from Angular conferences (and maybe Egghead.io too, they have some free).

      There's also Ngrx, but I'm not entirely sure how often its used in Ionic, if at all.
