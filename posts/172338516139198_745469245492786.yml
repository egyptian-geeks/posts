      I am not a troll so don't worry :)
      My comment are purely on code ...
      1- There is something wrong with your "build" process ...If you checked the HTML you will find comments that should be handled by Grunt's usemin task  <!-- build:js --> , <!-- build:CSS --> ... I am sure you know what these are supposed to do.
      2- You are using the whole set of Modernizr's features on the homepage ... You are supposed to generate a custom version containing the features you are using. That's 50Kb of features you don't need. You should only be using to test the features you are going to need. Or you can automate the process using Grunt-modernizr which is supposed to be a part of Grunt's tasks.
      3- Modernizr isn't included in the internal pages at all ... Do you really need it on the homepage?
      4- You are an awesome guy following the recommendations and using only one CSS file ... but you created a file for the homepage and another one for the internals *both* of them containing Bootstrap's CSS. This is adding 200KB on your users. Best thing is to revise that and merge the 2 files. Also Normalize ...
      5- You are not using all Bootstrap features ... You are using like 30% of it ... Why are you using the whole library? That's a huge performance hit.
      Personal note: I hate scroll hijacking no matter how beautiful is it done
      Design note: When viewing the landing page on iPhone, the graphics for eventuts doesn't fit well with the rest of the components.

    message: My thought is ... You rushed with launching and you missed those tiny
      things that the users won't see :) I am sure you were going to address these
      in the future ... Am just highlighting them because you know ... I am looking
      for attention :D LOL
