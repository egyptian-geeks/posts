      It freed 7.69 GB here, and I already do a disk cleanup every month of so, with all that free space I can now install VS2013 Update 2 :D
      (sadly it deleted IE's history as part of the "Temporary Internet Files", and I like keeping my browsing history :S)

    message: I hated losing history as well. In my case I use Chrome all the time,
      so, it asked me to enter my password again and then eventually got my history
      back. My extensions and settings were not touched through the process still,
      which was good news, even though they could've been restored via sync anyway.
