    message: Abdelhameed Tourky you need always on GPS and 3G connection for all these
      phones is google collecting data in background with that accuracy to determine
      speed changes and not only locations/streets?

    message: a good portion of those millions have their GPS and 3G working, and to
      verify the data from those phones, you can use the phones which have 3G working
      only, to get a low accuracy location and feed the traffic system even more!

      has around 92M phone, around 37% are  smartphones and increasing

    message: Dina El Shaer I didn't get what the history of travel means if you are
      talking about internal caching locations it won't be that accurate to collect
      location data.Put your phone on turn by turn navigation and compare it to background
      location on settings if you turned everything on even 3G and notice battery
      consumption difference we are talking about this level of accuracy

      At least I believe so. Not sure where the data is coming from though.

      Many of the comments here are really good, but did anyone tried to ask Google how they are doing this?

      Yes, I work at Google, but I'm not authorized to answer such questions. Also, I want to encourage people to get solid info instead of guessing :)

      data, lots of data from 3G/GPS even WiFi networks!!
      that makes inaccuracy level very low

      From Google Traffic's Wikipedia page [1]:
      Google Traffic works by analyzing the GPS-determined locations transmitted to Google by a large number of mobile phone users. By calculating the speed of users along a length of road, Google is able to generate a live traffic map. Google processes the incoming raw data about mobile phone device locations, and then excludes anomalies such as a postal vehicle which makes frequent stops. When a threshold of users in a particular area is noted, the overlay along roads and highways on the Google map changes color.[2]

      or areas that have communications infrastructure but can Google tracking cars
      in remote desolated areas like deserts or forests or oceans?
