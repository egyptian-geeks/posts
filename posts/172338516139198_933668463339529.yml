    message: 'Mostafa Hussein What I mean by custom made: 1. Net Install small iso,
      2. Manually install each package as needed. 3. No desktop environment (KDE,GNOME,
      MATE, Cinnamon) 4. I installed open box and even the file manager Thunar. 5.
      I installed the sound server to make sound. 6. I even compiled EMACS from source
      code and installed it. 7. I edited the xml file for conky to the right of the
      screen, and even the Panel on top (Tint) I made the XML for the settings.'

    message: Basically, I was trying to imitate a custom Debian called CrunchBang,
      a Debian OS with minimalist UI and services so it only starts at 150 MB (Crunchbang),
      my Debian starts at 75-85 MB :)
