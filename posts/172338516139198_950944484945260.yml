      It depends.
      In small teams working on their own etc, cool. I as a consultant working on a client site have to be very careful not to use them, even if the people on the client use it. In a country like Egypt also using swear words may be non-female developer friendly.
      It's just politics. You have to be aware what best fits the environment you want to fit in.

      Hmmm, Mohamed Meligy's comments gave me the impression that you are complaining?! Dude, swear words are fun! :D

      I don't know why I remember this now, but one time a leader in my company was playing mind games with the team. He asked us: You know what counts for filing sexual harassment complaints? It's only the perception of the receiver.

      The intention of the person accused, or even their actual actions don't count in considering an assault case and filing it, only the perception. The actions and intention only matter later, in the investigations after the case is filed..

      Thanks to all shared their thoughts.

      Another question, shouldn't one take care of his language and tone when using swear woeds because it might sound like offending someone?

      I would immediately give a warning that I will not work under such conditions.
      If this warning is not acknowledged, I would liquidate the job. Within a team
      working on a job, I don't give a ****.
