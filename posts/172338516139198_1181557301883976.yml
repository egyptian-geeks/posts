      yeah they are partial restriction on SSL Connections Including HTTPS, Imap, Pop3 and Throttling on VPN connections and apparently this problem only occurred partial Net block and not the whole world.

      this been like 3 days and still persist and I believe this maybe another fail result of NTRA trying to block VoIP or could be something bigger gov doing and blocking VoIP just a mask *Conspiracy Theory*

      P.S: I got SSL on my server and timezone is correct but still I can't connect to it and Timezone is not the issue. because what is changed the DST and not the actual time.
