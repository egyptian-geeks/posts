  would like to partner up with software developers for building our new blood donation
  system. The system is planned to have a bleeding edge tech stack from the front
  end till the Kafka-like event driven backend.\n\nHere is what we are striving for
  technically with our partners (software developers)\n\n1. Open source code. All
  of our systemâ€™s code would be open sourced on GitHub\n\n2. Readable code\n\n3. Intuitive
  architecture\n\n4. Decoupled code\n\n5. Proper naming\n\n6. Fast system reproducibility\n\nHere
  are the skills that need to be met. At least one skill is needed to join.\n\n1.
  Node.js\n\n2. Angular\n\n3. React\n\n4. React native\n\n5. UI/UX Mobile App Designer\n\n6.
  GitHub open source project manager (would set rules for merging and commit naming
  conventions, and would manage ticket issues, etc)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nif
