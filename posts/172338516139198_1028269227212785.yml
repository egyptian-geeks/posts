    message: One small thing they didn't address here, what will happen to the free
      charging stations? If similar non-tesla electric vehicles get made, will they
      also get charged for free in these stations? If not then how will their system
      differentiate? (I'm assuming the whole thing is automated, mafeesh wa7ed wa2ef
      fel "banzeena" :D)

  - description: Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our
      Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed,
      in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle
      technology.
