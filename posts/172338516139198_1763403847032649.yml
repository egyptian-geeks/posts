  What is the best way to make the code more readible if you have 3,4 conditions in if statement.

      This looks like a classic case of what Martin Fowler calls "anemic domain models." If you use an object in every statement in a method then this probably means the method should be in the class of said object. I'd extract this condition to User.isVerified() or something along the lines of this.

      If you wanna even optimize this further and not have the ugly if statement conditions then you can create a UserVerification model (that the User owns) which has a dictionary [this is Swift, right? :D] of [Enum : Bool] or something. The dictionary hosts all the verifications you require as keys and the value of each is either true if verified or false of not verified. Then the UserVerification have a method like:

      func isVerified(verifications: [VerificationOption : Bool]) -> Bool {
          return !Array(verifications.values).contains(false)
      }
