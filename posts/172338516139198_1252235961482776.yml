      My advice basically is to do projects as possible as you can. Make sure you always be part of something.  This is the real exp you should follow. And the best project based platform for software/dev skills is udacity. This platform is amazing.

      Plus, if you can contribute in any open source  is project it would be excellent.

      Your expectations are weird. You should expect your college to teach you computer science. In fact, if you pay attention to the foundational stuff (data structures, compilers, OS, AI, image processing) you will be a very good developer. I was taught this stuff in college, in Egypt and it made all the difference.

      The coding skills, the experience with different platforms will not come from courses but from doing stuff and playing with stuff yourself, but you should absolutely assume the courses in College will help and pay attention to them. I am talking about Egypt. Every good Egyptian developer I met here in the US in big companies was good from back home paying attention to computer foundation stuff.
