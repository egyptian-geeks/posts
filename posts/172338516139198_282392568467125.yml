      I have done with both courses and it gave me a good experience on working with ROR but as a PHP Developer i have used to just upload and set up my sql db, so i had the following problems

      - Deployment is my killer Issue
      - i need moreeeeeeee ... you know it is hard when you are a geek in PHP then just an amateur in ROR.

      What i mean if i can build a blog with same structure like any blogg e.g. WordPress (Posts, Categories, Tags, Comments, Relations) etc...

      and Deploy and Upload it ...  then i can say i'm good at ROR

      Actually the 2 courses you mentioned helped me much but they are not enough to start coding real projects
