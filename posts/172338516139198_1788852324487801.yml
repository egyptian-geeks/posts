message: I created a 3D model using Blender then I exported it to unity. Is there
  any function in unity that can bend 3D models while running the scene ?I'm creating  magentic
  field patterns for a magnet and im trying to bend the curved lines only when there
  are other magnets near it

      You can write a shader or deform the mesh using code(not recommend) , it should be pretty straight forward if you have a mathematical model (if you are doing a simulation).

      Try reading about geometry and fragment shaders.

      Can you please elaborate ?
