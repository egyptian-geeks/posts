    message: I’m not sure if anyone would let go of alamofire with its huge community
      and start using yours, I’m not making any bad assumptions here but you’re learning
      a lot about networking layer and all, but it would be more useful to you and
      community to make use of your skills in any other existing library, such as
      alamofire or others, I saw your first lib and this’s now the second, and you’re
      not gonna be maintaining this forever for sure, hope you got my point
