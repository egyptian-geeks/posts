message: I thought I could share this with you, may people I know will certainly like
  this. Remember Design Patterns :D the very first book that was written about them
  was published in 1995 by The Gang of Four. This guy here has taken a very good initiative
  to bring back design patterns to the 21st century and reapplying them to modern
  languages

    message: The GOF patterns are still very much relevant today, what I would add
      is a section for functional design patterns like the Closure and Prototype.
      Otherwise. "Modern" languages are still OO with functional features.
