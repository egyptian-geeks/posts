      Independence, in the sense that they don't need hand holding to get their job done.
      Deliver no matter what, dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty is part of the job, so deal with it.
      Educate up and sideways, you are expected to educate managers and peers, don't expect your manager to be more technical than you, s/he is relying on you to lead the team technically.
      In short, you should have a wider scope as well as influence on your team and cross team

      What makes a senior developer:
      1- Has a wide range of technologies often in the front-end and back-end.
      2- Has a reasonable understanding of design patterns.
      3- He is exposed to know SQL databases but not necessarily expert in the area.
      4- He is familiar with messaging tools and frameworks.
      5- Able to troubleshoot problems fast.
      6- Can think of different solutions to solve a problem and can explain the pros and cons of each solution from different point of view, such performance, scalability, security, maintainability and so on.
      7- Can write cleaner and more maintainable code.
      8- Able to right unit tests, integration tests and so on.

      In my opinion, technical knowledge consists of 3 parts:
      1- knowing how to use X
      2- knowing when to use X
      3- knowing how X works
      A senior should understand those 3 aspects of the subject of his/her expertise.

    message: A senior engineer is someone who works beyond technology and algorithms.
      It's someone who had build an entire system without actually building any specific
      part in it. Think of a senior engineer as a junior architect with a bit more
      focus on the code

    message: I think as a senior software engineer you have to have basic understanding
      of the different applications’ patterns /services’/components’  design & architecture
      models and how & when to implement them based on your business requirements
      like (service oriented, n-tier, multi-layered, distributed system, multi-tenant,
      multi-threaded, object oriented, loosely coupled components/classes/interfaces,
      asynchronous communication, gang of four design patterns, etc..).

      like single responsibility, open-closed patterns, interface segregation, dependency

      A senior engineer usually:
      * Advices senior management and managers, and mentors other engineers.
      * Operates across different teams in his organization.
      * Deals very well with ambiguity
      * Gets the job done
      * Has architected and design non-trivial projects
