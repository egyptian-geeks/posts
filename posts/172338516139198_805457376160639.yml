      [wordpress shortcode] to the post (I have a plugin that allows me to append
      things to posts). But from quick reading it seems WordPress doesn't have a builtin
      shortcode for widgets.

      the plugins own codes as well

      using something that fiends suggest. Ideally I'll soon be also looking for one
      of those pop-up things, setting it to show only after users have read the post.

      Mohamed Meligy This is what you need https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-sidebars/

      You create a new sidebar from Wordpress admin and per post you can set which one to be loaded after the post. Although you might need to include the custom sidebar include after your post.

    message: The sidebar is the term is not the location of the widget content, you
      can have a "sidebar" in the footer or in the header, not necessarily it's the
      right block on the blog or the left one. the sidebar also is the only place
      that can hold your widget. can you share a link to your blog please?
