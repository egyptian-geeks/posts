  for anyone who has issues with the previous video:

  [[-- Make sure to play in 720P or 1080P - Check 3rd icon in player's bottom right corner --]]

  This is a throw-away video to test editing the Rode Podcaster microphone output, but the idea is that some operations in Angular.JS are very easy and you can make your own copies of them  and modify for your own need (just call them something else and there you go).

  Here Meligy shows how simple the ng-controller is to implement if you know how to implement a directive in general (and if you don't, read the docs on it, or ask @Meligy about what's stopping you!).
