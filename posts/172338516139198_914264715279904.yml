      Don't start your business with accelerator, it is too early to give up your company.

      Look for European or American accelerator that can accept your situation.

      them. actually I find it hard to believe that there are serious Egyptians or
      Arabian investors who believe in the power of software business, they would
      prefer spending millions on a new chips factory. \nAhmed E. Naiem , how to reach
      such accelerators. is there any real and proven examples of such cooperation
      ?"

      Our company is a Flat6Labs alumni from 2012. So to answer this question correctly, you should ask yourself:

      - What stage is my business at? Generally, the later you join the more useful the program should be (when you need the cash and connections).
      - Do I need funding or can I bootstrap?
      - Am I willing to give 15% of my company to get 100K in seed funding or is that too much.

      Now a European or US accelerator could be better, but do you have  a product/team that would get you accepted there?

    message: Thanks Ahmed Fathalla, actually the cash is needed in early stages to
      hire the developers. The 15% shouldn't be too much , but it is too much comparing
      to the amount of the 100K funding ,  the 100K is somehow low. if you need to
      hire two "non seniors" developers, you will burn the cache in less than 10 months.
