  Hi guys, I am following hacker news (news.ycombinator.com) recently and noticed that every two days a new programming language appear nearly without any new feature, I think the last well designed language was Scala since then nothing new, What about you do you think about any good PL that appear in the last ten years and have something to mention
  Thank you

      You're a language geek, Bassam, and at one point in time you will relate any new feature in any language to an old language.

      Here are some new languages I'm interested in & the interesting features: Go (goroutines), Nim (compile-time macros), Prolog (logic programming)

      i work on my own language as a side project trying to collect the best of all
      in one language maybe it looks silly but i had made good progress putting the
      specification and engineering a compiler, but it's so far
