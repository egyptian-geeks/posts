  Guys, just a wake up call. I am mainly a lurker here and I do not post that much, but I am turning off the notifications from the group and directing my attention else where.

  It is not like Einstein is leaving the group of course, but a humble notification of how the group is turning into a trivial Q/A forum every passing day. It is like 10% geeky stuff and 90% "would you please debug my code for me?"

      i know how'd you feel right now, i feel exactly the same, i think i'll have
      to be kinda strict as one of the admins, you can keep showing up here for the
      next couple days, report any post that seems not related to our group and i'll
      inform the user with a message as usual and will delete the post if it violates
      the rules (as usual also)

      few years back this group had tens of people almost everybody knew everybody
      else, no need to have written rules, and everything was based on "Common Sense",
      after a while we had to add some rules, then we needed to enforce them, now
      I guess we need to deal with this similarly, we just need to find a good way
      to communicate this without being a**holes deleting posts and blocking users
      left and right and making everybody angry.

      This group was created to answer a question: I've passed the beginner phase, now what? We try to help each other gain more experience. You learnt SQL, so what the the differences between different DBs?

      There are many places on the internet for beginners resources. Google knows better than anyone here. Questions like "I just installed a DB. How can I connect to it?" is just lazy. He didn't even tell us what kind of DB he's using! and if he searched for on Google, he will find an answer (either in English or Arabic).

      This group is not against beginners. It's against laziness.

      you misunderstood my question, I meant, do you see a number beside every reported post showing how many times it was reported? Kind of like the number of downvotes on reddit.
      because sometimes when I'm about to report something, I fear that my judgement isn't good and an admin might take action based on just my and his judgement, but if the count shows up, this will make me more comfortable as it will be a combined judgement of many users :)

      Hassan Aly Selim no, there isn't a number next to a report stating how many people have reported it iirc, however you shouldn't worry about whether your judgment was good or not.
      If you felt the post was out of context or shouldn't have been posted then report it and we'll take care of it :)

      Yes, none of us is getting paid for this but I believe I can safely speak on behalf of a lot of admins here, we've grown quite fond of this small community and are constantly striving to see it successful despite our commitments, I'm serving in the military now and I still keep an eye on the group for at least 6-7 hours a week. I'm pretty sure a lot do the same.

      So thanks for the heads up and like most admins have already stated, reports do help us so feel free to carry on.
