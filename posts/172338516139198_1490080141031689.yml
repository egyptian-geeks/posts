  Opinion question:
  What do you think of services like AWS Lambda or google cloud functions?
   Have you ever used any?
  What do you think of it (good and bad stuff)?

    message: "AWS Lambda is a peace of mind technology.\nif  your request lifetime
      less than 200 ms it will pay a reasonable price .. bigger than this you will
      pay a fortune..\n\na simple example:\n128 MB   executed 1000000 every day run
      for 200 ms\nwill cost you $6.8 per month after subtract free tier compute \n\n128
      MB  executed 1000000 every day run for 1 second\nwill cost $62 per month\n\n128
      MB  executed 15000000 every day run for 1 second\nwill cost $1021\n\nThe free
      tier for Lambda is:\n1,000,000 free requests per month\nUp to 3.2 million seconds
      of compute time per month \nor 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month."

    message: I used AWS Lambda, it's mainly used to run some script based on some
      events in the AWS cloud but I think can also used to develop short running services
      (it has a timeout). Maybe we can share more experience if you have a specific
      question or let us know about your goals?

      We have been in our team using serverless stuff, we had more reliable services, less ops pain, we just suffered a little to be Fully on a CI path, but it got easier by time, now making lots of stuff regionally redundant with lambda.
      We pay for our cloudwatch metrics more than Lambda... :D
