    message: the idea is briliant, and is simple to make, is using phone camera for
      face recognition if the aim circle of gun matched on same direction of the user
      face while shooting this what gonna make you killed. I guess the game maybe
      has auto discovery for nearby opponents around you like an alarm or something
      like in the video maybe by using gps and 3g, but in this case is gonna really
      kill your phone battery and also I may try this game for one or two. but playing
      this all times ? c'mon ClashOfClans still best game for mobiles :P

      You don't need face recognition at all. I saw the same idea but without the dependency on using your phone while playing. and the phone is only a score machine.

      The video is in spanish, but you can see the video: http://vimeo.com/99256872
