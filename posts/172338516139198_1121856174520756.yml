  Europe's largest innovation competition for satellite navigation is starting into the next round

  Since 2004 we are organising the European Satellite Navigation Competition, the largest ideas contest that annually awards the best services, products, or business innovations using SATELLITE NAVIGATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE. The competition serves as a Europe-wide support mechanism for entrepreneurs, start-ups, SMEs, students, researchers, individuals that and all participants to get their business off the ground. The competition comprises the largest innovation network in satellite navigation with support from more than 130 key GNSS stakeholders and regional partners as well as the largest space-related incubation network. It has already awarded prizes to more than 270 winners over the years, which represent just a fraction of the nearly 3,500 innovative concepts submitted by over 10,000 total participants. Everyone with a brilliant idea is welcome to join and submit their entries from 1 April - 30 June 2016 at: www.esnc.eu
