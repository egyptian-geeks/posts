message: "Greetings, \nI want to build a \"flights search engine\" based on human
  language.\nIn other words, the user searches for \"flights from Cairo to London
  today.\", then the app should find all flights with \"Source =Cairo\", \"destination
  = London\", and \"date = Time.Today\".\n\nWhat I have found so far, that this is
  related to NLP(Natural Language processing), which can do something like identifying
  of classes of entities within the sentence(determine if it's a location, date, person).\n\nNow,
  I don't have a clear idea about what to do next, should i use regex intensively,
  or mix of if & else, or am I on the wrong track?\nI would appreciate if you have
  samples or a simple tutorial to do such thing or more importantly, if there is no
  sample, ازاى ممكن افكر صح فى حاجة زى كده؟\nnote: the app will be asp.net, but samples
  in other languages are welcomed.\nSample of c# library: http://sharpnlp.codeplex.com/"

      after you sort out your NLP part you will need a source for the flight data. the QPX api gives you 50 free queries per day.
      I suggest you start buy practicing the API. when you are able to use it effectively, move on to the NLP stage to translate the queries to the API calls.
      Have you seen any leading website in the world made with asp.net ? I am curious why people use this stuff?

      What's wrong with a simple /(.*)\s+to\s+(.*)/ and then comparing with a list of airport names to get the longest right-most match for $1 and the longest left-most match for $2?

      For parsing the natural time expressions, you can use Stanford NLP's SUtime.

      Do you have any queries in mind where such a simple approach wouldn't suffice?
