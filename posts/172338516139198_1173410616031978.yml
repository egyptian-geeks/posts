      Heh, I was implementing a simple TCP service once and couldn't get it to work. At first I thought, the hardware was at fault, but then I grepped through the code base and found other instance of doing TCP without a problem. The socket calls where all protected by semaphores, a total waste for system calls but if it makes the original programmer feel safer, why not?

      Turns out, the other module where TCP worked, among the dozens of includes, included a header defining macros that shadowed the socket syscalls, and instead did all the TCP/IP processing in userspace and finally stuffed the frames into a kernel-side message queue, which just blew them out the NIC.

      I stil don't know why (I guess "well, it was working, so when we switched to Linux we just ported our old stack as well"), but I have trust issues ever since.
