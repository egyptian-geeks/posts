    message: I don't believe there is a law against it. But if you knock on the wrong
      door, it is not the law that will be responding either :D

    message: Ashraf Kaabi  it was a figure of speech ya but let me follow with you  ,
      if i recorded your home after you open the door that's is an invasion of privacy
      right  ?? how about if i just took a picture of your door form the outside ?
      and how about if i recorded your home doorbell ? these are thing intended to
      be publicly displayed

    message: You cannot actually record the inside of my house even if I willingly
      open the door unless you have clear permission to do so. The exterior of the
      house is public info of course, but being legal does not always mean nice ;)

      Assuming door visibility is public (which will be up to interpretation of not-so-educated officials), public recording requires a permit anyway.

      Plus in these mad times, wrong interpretation could possibly end your life (literally or in long prison stay equal to death), for accusation of being a spy.
