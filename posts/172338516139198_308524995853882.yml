      While working on a CSS file, we usually need to refresh the web page each time a new style is added or edited to see how it looks.

      CSSrefresh is a JavaScript file which automizes this process by instantly applying the new styles. And, without refreshing the page.

      It is a plug 'n' play solution and nothing to configure. Just insert the JavaScript file into the web pages and you are ready to go.

      Optionally, there is a bookmarklet which can be simply clicked to activate CSSrefresh without inserting the JS file.
