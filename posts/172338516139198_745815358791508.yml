    message: "Nonetheless, I think the idea is brilliant but not sure it falls under
      a virus classification. It's certainly a malware, but a virus? Sounds debatable.
      \nThe sole purpose of a virus is to corrupt data in an irreversible way, not
      to hold data hostage."

      That blackmail though... te2eela! O_O
      just a small correction for the info about Bitcoin, the transaction info isn't just stored on the miners' computer, it's on every client (first time you run the client you have to download the whole thing, unless you have a lightweight client), also Bitcoin (and crypto-currencies in general) aren't completely anonymous, with some (significant) effort you can trace the money you spent to the guy up to the point were he uses it to purchase something (then "maybe" the merchant can cooperate with you and give you details about him), but of course if he used a bitcoin mixing service then you can say goodbye to tracing :D

      old files after encryption but maybe you can recover with disk recovery software
