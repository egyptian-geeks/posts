      the gap between the difficulty and the price of the coin is only getting wider,
      it's no longer worth the price of the hardware, and as a whole it's not a very
      viable investment.

      Bitcoin mining is actually a Dirty game for Big Data processing without the need of building Supercomputers , Encryption methods that needs tens of years can now be done easly on the mines ,

      the dirty thing about this is that you do not know what the hell are you processing ... you might be processing data for US Army to help launching a new rocket to our Arab countries , You might be helping Israel in building new destroying tech. or mafia in hacking bank accounts ...... :)

      cryptocoin gambling sites, which became extremely popular, you can simply win
      a couple of coins based on a $5 investment but as gambling goes you can lose
      everything if you're not careful, but be careful gambling is very..very..addictive.

      Arabs Knight: If you're into very technical details, read the Bitcoin whitepaper: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
      Or you can read a few things on the wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation
      If you just want the basic info: http://www.weusecoins.org/

      The whole thing is opensource and many people compile the software themselves to guarantee security.
      Its security is based on asymmetric cryptography (public and private keys) using the elliptic curve approach, all these are proven security systems used everywhere.

      I wouldn't personally use the term "lottery" to describe it (gives a negative feeling), I would describe it as rolling a dice that has 2^32 faces ... which still sound like "lottery" :D
      But anyways, I think it's important that people understand that mining is there as an incentive to let people secure the network (as you have to verify all the transactions in the past 10 minutes before you can start hashing), and it's increasing difficulty is just a way to programatically limit the amount of inflation in the currency (as opposed to having a government do that), and that one day there will be no more bitcoins generated and the incentive will be all the tiny transaction fees which *should* be enough by that time as there will by much more transactions happening by then.

      First of all I want to make sure you know that in our current economy (in most countries) this paper money is not backed by any tangible assets, nezam el gold dah kan zaman w we2ef (mafeesh 3'eta2 dahab 7'alas), the value of the dollar is drived by demand and supply, demand depends on many things like how much exporting a country does and how powerful it is in general, and supply is controlled by the national bank. I'd also like to make sure you know that now money is mostly digital (banks don't have vaults full of paper money like in the movies).
      Now with that clear, let's look at bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is also determined based on demand and supply, the supply is controlled by an algorithm that everybody uses (if anybody decided to use another algorithm, they will produce invalid data and thus blocked by all other nodes in the network!), the demand is driven by people wanting to buy bitcoin to use it to by things more easily (it's better than credit cards and paypal in many aspects).
      Some peope though say that it's backed by computational power, or basically how much electricity you had to pay to generate the coins (hashing 10^9 times per second consumes electricity!), so you can say that its value can never be less than that otherwise people will not mine, and if there are less miners then the difficult decreases (according to an algorithm that everybody uses) and thus you'll eventually need less energy to generate the same amount of coins, so the whole system balances itself automatically! It's always generating exactly the same amount of botcoins every 10 minutes and that amount is halved every 4 years!

      Now onto hashing, effort is put into figuring out the nonce that satisfies the target (a hash with a certain number of censecutive zeros in the beginning, that's the difficulty), the data you hash is basically info about the transactions that happened in the last 10 minutes, by all of us collectively putting this effort to verify these transactions, this guarantees that no single person could push false transaction data (pay for with money he doesn't have for example!), for fraud to happen a person has to have OWN more than 50% of the GLOBAL hashing power, which is basically impossible!
      This is how bitcoins keeps itself secure! We all collectively ensure it's security, there is no single entity in control of any thing, it's all Decentralized!

      the fees themselves don't decrease, but if you're mining with a group of people (where if one of you solves the block, the bitcoins are distributed over all of the group) then yes you get less coins out of your effort, and yes this balances itself back when some miners leave due to low "profitability".
      But also as bitcoin gets more popular, there will be more transactions and thus more fees, so more miners will join, which is good because a bigger network needs more peolpe securing it.

      But just note that currently miners profit not just from the transaction fees (this will be the case eventually after many years), they also get newly created coins, currently only 25 bitcoins are created every 10 minutes, this will get halves in 2016 and every 4 years until it's very close to zero. This is present because it's a fair-ish way to startup a currency and distribute it evenly accross its users (yeah it's not the most fair thing ever, but it's not that bad), it's also a way to encourage miners (who secure the network) when the currency is still in its early days and there aren't enough transactions happening to pay off the miners, which is also not a bad idea.

      I know, creating 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes out of thin air sounds very weird and sounds like something that's wrong, and yes it does make new cryptocurrencies (clones, called alt-coins) feel very bad and indeed some evil things happen in the world of alt-coins (search for "pump and dump"). But after a currency becomes popular enough like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin these days, it's not as bad.

      What do you mean by mining pools in Egypt? A pool is just a server with the wallet software, a Stratum server, and a mining pool frontend (the most common one is php-mpos).
      I've went through a lot of pools as I was learning about mining, I'm not a serious miner though because I don't have an ASIC (nor plan to buy one) and my GPU is very old (GT 240), but I do plan to consider mining again when I buy a new gaming GPU :D

      well, on the "Bitcoin Egypt User Group" FB Group there are a few who are interested in mining, but not enought to be a mining community I think.
      and GPU mining is obsolete for SHA256 and Scrypt coins, it's not obsolete for Scrypt-n, X11 and other algorithms, you can mine the coins that use these and trade them for BTC and LTC.
