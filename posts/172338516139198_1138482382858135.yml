  Interesting fact: there is something called dev bootcamps that is becoming popular here in San Francisco, you join an extensive 9-week course that runs everyday from 9-to-5, you start from scratch, and by the end of the bootcamp you are ready to start working. It doesn't require any background, and they are proud that even baristas can join the program and get hired at tech after it.
  All of that is indeed interesting, but the most interesting fact is that one of the three co-founders is EGYPTIAN :) He even studied in Egypt and then moved to SF.

    message: I know about bootcamps but I can't really wrap up my mind in how a person
      with no tech background can be fluent programmer and ready for work in weeks.
      That is why I think it raise the bar for every real geek to learn programming
      as a tool then move out to do more specific things like AI and machine learning
      since it will need real math and certain set of skills.

      We need to ask ourselves a question, how many courses we studied that we really used in our daily dev tasks. I would say 15%.
      So bootcamps can prove many success stories in this field.
