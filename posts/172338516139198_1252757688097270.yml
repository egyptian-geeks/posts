message: "I've started a bit with WordPress design, I want to ask if there's a good
  written or visual course that has a very clear path that you'd recommend, because
  I lose my thread of thoughts when I read the documentation (it appears that it's
  a reference rather than a learning material).\n\nSo, my question is: Is there any
  good material with a good learning curve that summarize the course of learning WP
  themes?\nand I want your opinion in this framework, did anyone used it before? What
  are your comments about it?\nhttps://understrap.com/\n\nPS: I know that bootstrap
  is very unlikely to be used with WP as it's not the right choice for WP, to relate

  welcomed to correct me if I've said anything wrong"

    message: Tuts+ and Lynda offers some video tutorials on Wp theming. I agree with
      some of the article you share on Bootstrap, However that you will face a lot
      of problems with WP theming. I have done it with many projects and no big issues
      at all.

      wordpress has been failing developers all over. \nthey even announced major
      changes in their platform but it semis like that didn't help either. \nthey
      even announced a new platform called Calypso but that didn't have any luck either.
