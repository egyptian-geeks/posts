message: "I have always found biologically-inspired algorithms to be incredibly interesting.
  They are usually useful for optimization problems. One such algorithm that is rather
  simple and intuitive is Particle Swarm Optimization.\n\nThis algorithm models the
  behavior of a bird flock, where each bird in the swarm/flock is a potential solution
  to the problem and the birds fly through the search space to find the global optimum.\n\nMost
  algorithms that do that try to strike a balance between \"exploration\" and \"exploitation\".
  Where initially the search space is widely explored, with possible optima influencing
  the search direction slightly. As the search goes on, the algorithm gradually shifts
  to an exploitation stage, where the search is \"focused\" around a potential optimum
  (here, the search would exploit the position of the optimal bird in the flock).
  The balance between both stages usually depends on how you tweak the algorithm's
  parameters, and is very important: A highly exploratory implementation may never
  converge to a solution, while a highly exploitative one could converge very quickly
  but get stuck in a local optimum. \n\nAnother example is the \"Ant colony\" algorithm
  which has been used to solve the traveling salesman problem, and in routing protocols,
  since ants are clever at finding shortest/optimal paths in that case.\n\n"

  - description: In computer science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational
      method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate
      solution with regard to a given measure of quality. PSO optimizes a problem
      by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, andâ€¦
