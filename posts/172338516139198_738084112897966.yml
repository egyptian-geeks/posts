    message: In a bank environment they lock every file upload / download to IE only
      via some admin stuff. Vulnerabilities are often discovered in every OS and browser
      (often by white hat hackers / security experts), and they are not a good indication
      of which is most secure.

    message: Actually, some see it the other way around, since nothing is 100% secure,
      the browser with least "patched" vulnerabilities might -just might- be simply
      the most vulnerable.

      You may have a point here but Microsoft stopped supporting XP therefore there might wont be a patch for this issue for these users and I don't know if Microsoft will make an exception for this case or not
      Also as far as I know Microsoft still didn't release a patch till now which makes us all vulnerable :)
