      It is quite simple. Google was wrong ethically, but right legally. A company has the right to fire any employee if they feel like him/her staying in the company will cause a negative environment & disruption in the company stability. Not to mention, Google did not violate the first amendment.

      My 5 cent is that Google is wrong, as I put ethics first, then legality! Those who know me know that I fight for feminism, but that is not a feminist move! That is a show move

      he wasn't just speaking for himself but also for his department and he questioned
      how they spend money and the programs they were making for women .

    message: 'But the article is wrong, not Google... A post by an employee in a workplace
      saying that a segment of the employees are just les qualified and less capable
      by nature (while pretending to not be specific to one) is intimidating to people
      of that group. If you were 3 Muslims in a company of 100 non-Muslims, and one
      guy emails the diversity council and says studies have shown that Muslims are
      a lot less likely to be mangers at Google (fact) and therefore we should not
      try so hard to make sure we''re being fair to Muslims when it''s time to get
      promoted. If he sends that email and you see it and then you learn the response
      from leadership was: Nothing. How would you not feel intimidated? When it''s
      time for you to get promoted and your leadership said they believe the guy''s
      memo is one of a few possible opinions, how would you not think they are biased
      against you?'
