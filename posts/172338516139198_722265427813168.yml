  Open source team chat, might be useful for anyone who wants to dabble in Elixir, Erlang's good looking friend. It uses Ember too for most of its client side.
  Elixir smells like ruby but runs on the Erlang VM.

    message: I used HipChat in a couple projects in Readify. It's a great tool. Being
      able to drop a message / question to entire team is very helpful even when team
      is in the same room. In one project we even had another room where client representatives
      were present. It enhances things a lot.

      Very nice!
      Never looked for alternatives as my company has company-wide license, but sure will be in my head the next (first?) time I start something outside work with distributed team members.

    message: Team chat certainly improved our communication at Tabshora, quick short
      bursts of text, distraction is at your own discretion not forced onto you. When
      you have a few minutes to spare you can check your messages, otherwise you're
      focused on your task without interruptions.
