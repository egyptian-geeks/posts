    message: Nope, but some countries such as Germany for example still values any
      related higher education or qualifications, which technically make your access
      to the market much easier, but it don't think it affect salaries.

    message: For Germany, certificates are still important ...  It will differ in
      the type of Visa . .  some specialization (based on certificates) are considered
      highly qualified individuals and they get better visa conditions ... Some companies
      still also care which specialization have you studied and which degree do you
      have and they use it to calculate your salary .. w Allah a3lam

    message: Another example for a situation where it makes a difference.  to get
      a visa to work in CS field in Germany .. having a degree in CS makes it clear
      for the embassy that every thing is fine .. when it is not the case, one has
      to show them some proof that he is experienced enough for the job .. this is
      even  after  having a job offer.  Yet the person's skills and experience are
      enough (if proven) to compensate for all the above .

    message: "So we’re speaking about 2 different things here:\n\n1. The salary and
      its’ relationship to your qualifications\n\n - the employer will use any excuse
      to pay you less and it’s your responsibility and ability to negotiate a better
      offer which you can do if you know what you can bring on the table. I believe
      that this comes after obtaining a proven record of some solid experiences. \n\n2.
      Issuing the visa \n\n - Requirements differ from a country to another. In general,
      a software job  -any STEM-related job- is considered a highly skilled job which
      requires a graduate school certificate which is recognisable in the country
      where's the job at. The graduate certificate here has to be in a field related
      to the job offer you have. I can tell you from an experience that obtaining
      a working visa without a degree is almost impossible at least in Germany. \n\nI
      also believe that exceptions may occur when you’re exceptional. Usually, if
      you look at the immigration laws -it's the best source for those type of information-
      in Europe you’ll find what exceptional means.  \n\nIn a nutshell, look for a
      job and try obtaining a visa. you'll never know where it’ll lead you at the
      end but in my experience, it’s better than not trying."

      years, I was working in top companies there and I did interview with eBay, booking
      etc,,, \nno one refused me because I did not complete my CS degree, because
      I have a clear reason, some companies refused me because they think I'm over
      qualified.\nit will make some difficulties, but if you can prove yourself and
      you have clear reason, then you can do it.\nbut also some countries make it
      very hard to get the visa."
