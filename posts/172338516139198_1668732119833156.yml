message: "Egyptian OpenVPN Users (especially corporate users): \nAre you still unable
  to use OpenVPN? If not, how are you able to get around it?\n\nI am planning to visit
  Egypt in December, where I will also be working remotely which requires using OpenVPN
  and I am wondering how people (especially those who who have to use OpenVPN for
  their work) are able to manage.\nI don't really want to resort to things like SSL
  tunneling on Egypt's already-lousy Internet."

    message: "To use any of the methods that are being mentioned out there requires
      adaptions to the \"VPN server\". that said, it means someone from the work needs
      to change it. \n\nwhat you can do in case you can't change the server config:-\n1.
      Setup your own VPN with whatever method to overcome the government DPI system.\n2.
      connect to the work VPN through the first one. In some cases that may require
      alteration to the config file if it was configured to redirect all the traffic.
      \n\nso that's how it'll look at the end \nInternet -> Private VPN -> Work VPN
      -> you\n\nHope it helps :)"

      SSL tunneling is the only way

      stunnel and i think the company outside can setup an stunnel server for such
      cases.
