      if you are using python i think scrapy will do the task ,also you can use native python which i think is more fun to learn how the scrapers work .
      if you are using php you can use Curl to scrape data ,it depends more on regular expression not like python (which have css ,xpath selectors).
      this is example i wrote using scrapy it was scraping games from mazika2day : https://github.com/aa-ahmed-aa/GameSpider
      and this is another native python script that scrape the price of the dollar in multiple banks: https://github.com/GardiansLab/Bank-Currency
