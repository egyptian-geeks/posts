  It bothers me you have to go so "low" to write a high performance library ...

    message: I had an impression that most of the performance optimizations come from

  - description: Writing a Really, Really Fast JSON Parser Several holidays ago, I
      got a bee in my bonnet and wrote a fast JSON parser whose parsed AST fits in
      a single contiguous block of memory. The code was small and simple and the performance
      was generally on-par with RapidJSON, so I stopped and moved on with my...
