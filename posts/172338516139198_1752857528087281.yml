message: "Hey guys, I developed this cryptocurrency rates app a couple of months ago,
  and currently, I don't have enough time to enhance it or add more features. So if
  any if you are interested to join and continue enhancing it and add a couple of
  more features based on a revenue-share model, please let me know.\n\nTechnologies
  used:\nBackend: Rails-API, PostgreSQL\nFrontend: Ionic (Latest)\n\nCurrent revenues:
  $0, we need to add some ads in Android version and create a free version with ads
  for iOS.\n\nWhat's unique about it? Local currencies and more localizations should
  be added, as most of the current apps support only big currencies (USD, EUR, GBP,
  etc.)\n\nAndroid:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptorates.free&hl=ar\n\niOS:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crypto-rates-pro/id1297620913?mt=8\uFEFF"
