  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, have we dropped all hope in enforcing the group rules? The group is full of posts that are either job ads or questions by people who are too lazy to type into Google. There are quality posts that get buried beneath all of that.

  I'm not just venting or throwing rhetorical questions. Is it undoable, doable but needs more personnel, or deemed  as not important anymore?

    message: Some people seem to just not care, deleting such posts would suffice.
      But the majority seem to not get it. They either have the "if you don't like
      it ignore it" or "I'm asking the experts to save time" mentality. And anecdotally
      this phenomenon seems more spread in Arab communities. Maybe we need to be proactive
      about solving this.

      انا لغيت دلوقتي بوستس كتير من امبارح كانت irrelevant او without search effort وبعت لاصحابها السبب.
      انا ساعات مابرضاش الغي للبوست علشان فيه ناس كتبت تعليقات كتير عليه فعلشان كده ياريت الناس لما تلاقي حد سأل منغير مايكتب هو دور ولقي ايه وشكله مكروت السؤال مايبقوش يردوا علشان ردهم بيشجعه يمشي علي نفس المنوال كل مرة

      I would just like to say that even though this group can still get better, it's already much better than a lot of other developer groups.
      An example of a group where most people don't know how to ask (or don't know what they're looking for) is egy c# developers, I tried helping people there a lot, but at the end I gave up.
