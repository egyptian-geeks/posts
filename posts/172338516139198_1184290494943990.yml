message: I have a question in closures, i excute and i understand the concept but
  what i made extra was to Console.log(MakeGreeting.language) after passing language
  as an argument, my question is isn't supposed to console " es " or "en" from the
  outer environment ? why it's undefined as when i log it but defined when i call
  the function expression ?

    message: makeGreeting is a function that return a function ... You're trying to
      access language as if it is a property of an object. It should return undefined.
      This isn't issue related to closure :)

    message: Ok what made me examine this, is based on the concept of functions are
      objects and if it's about scope isn't the outer environment accessible?! I'm
      confused as hell

      Since you're digging into JavaScript core to understand the internals I would recommend you read this book. This is one of the best AND the worst books to read about JavaScript.
