    message: you are correct in this actually :) but you know some times you need
      a complicated app to do a punch of actions rather than having 10 installed apps.
      but I totally agree with your point.

    message: Sure you need set of actions, but that depend on what you do actually,
      so if you work with a huge team ... each one specified at one or two tasks,
      and here comes the native & simple apps, but if you work alone or on small team
      ... you need complex software or may be whole systems to do all the job.
