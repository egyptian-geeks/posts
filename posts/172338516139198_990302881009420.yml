      How Is 3D Design Software Improving Building Designs?
      By Ankur Sharma

      Before 3D design software was introduced, there were many cases when the entire project need to be redone, simply because the designer and the client could not visualize identically. However, the situation has drastically changed.

      Designing buildings has always been a very meticulous task, requiring special expertise and experience of the highest order. However, ever since the inception of 3D design software, the entire scenario has undergone a sea change, and there is now a lot more scope for flexibility and inculcating the client's ideas into the design at every stage. The reason for this widespread usage is not just because of the fact that it's the latest trend, but also because it's a very utilitarian approach to getting the job done.

      To begin with, using 3D design software means that any kind of changes can be done at the planning stage itself, since the architect will showcase a walkthrough of sorts, and if the client has any problems, the issues can be sorted at that stage itself. This was certainly not possible in case of the old world approach of drawing. It was extremely difficult to explain to the client what the final structure would look like. Everything was based upon assumptions, and this often meant that the whole project needed to be re-executed, simply because it did not meet the expectations of the client.

      However, with 3D design software, many things can be put into perspective, much to the delight of designers as well as clients, for the simple reason that work can be done more efficiently, with lesser labor and faster results. Creating a virtual map and walkthroughs give the client an exact picture of what is to be made, leaving no room for obscurity and doubt.
