      You should leave your job if you are not getting enough money, enough respect, good environment, etc...   but never for not getting enough knowledge.

      Companies are not schools and work is boring, repeatable, that's actually what makes money for the companies. if  companies have to deal with a learning curve time alot, that definitely means losing money :)

      if your work is routine and repetitive, work on yourself, learn new technologies. but never leave for only this reason

      and investing in yourself. the new learnings could be non technical. Not being
      challenged at your current job is a clear sign that you need to change something."

      not to get knowledge. Learning new and exciting this is surely a plus, but it’s
      not the goal. Want to get more knowledge? Study/try new things on your free
      time. Doesn’t want to use your free time to get more knowledge? Meh, so you...'
