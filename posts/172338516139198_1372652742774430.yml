message: "Hi, I know this is weird question to ask, but has anyone here tried to buy
  something from Aliexpress? if yes was it delivered ok? or did you have any problems
  that can be avoided? what's a good way to pay? \n\nI want to buy some ARM microcontroller
  boards which i can't find at all in Egypt, this is an  stm32f103 (ARM Cortex-M3
  72MHz 64k flash and 8k ram) microcontroller board that can be programmed in C or
  using the Arduino IDE, it's 1.8$ each which means if it has 100% taxes on it, it
  becomes 2.6$ which is around 70 LE, compare that to an arduino uno now 25$ for an
  8-bit mcu, or a Chinese clone of the uno which is sold for 110LE (for an 8 bit avr
  16MHz 32k flash and 2k ram). \nHere is an advice, if you are an instructor teaching
  Embedded systems start using there, a college student with a embedded systems or
  robotics project these will greatly improve the quality of your project and processing
  power, if you have an electronics store or a company that can import these please
  do, low power IoT and embedded systems is the future and ARM architecture dominates
  that market."

      I did buy from aliexpress several times, electronic components mostly.
      Had no issues so far with any order except that it usually takes 30+ days to arrive for every single order.
