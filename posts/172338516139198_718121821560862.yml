      Print all your facebok liked pages names, URLs and when did you like it

      this is pretty easy, facebook provide us with all your likes
      and when did you like it, the simple problem is it provide it
      as pages so iterate till you get all pages.

      Facebook API docs says that each page object has a link attribute
      i thought that was the page link on facebook, then i found that it
      was always empty, so i formed the URL using the page ID as :
      facebook.com/:id

      this script was done for a simple purpose, facebook had an issue yesterday
      lots of mages are created in 18th with likes over 700K so i suspected that
      this is a copy/merge, so i had to write thsi script to get all my pages and
      another friend pages to see which page is doing that thing.

      unforunatily we still didn't figure it out :D
