    message: I totally agree with that perspective, SPA use cases should be limited
      to websites that really can't work otherwise like a media player or chat application

    message: I would like to add also for young developers, it's not a good idea to
      follow the hype, just because many people are using spas doesn't mean it's the
      best way to develop your app.

      BTW, the referenced link to how twitter enhanced its performance by reverting back to server-side rendering is nice.
      To improve the twitter.com experience for everyone, we’ve been working to take back control of our front-end performance by moving the rendering to the server. This has allowed us to drop our initial page load times to 1/5th of what they were previously and reduce differences in performance across browsers.
