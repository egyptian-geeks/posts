    message: I think Google has put more effort in some of their stuff, actually I
      felt a bit disappointed I couldn't create files and folders in this, as it seems
      easy to just map that to the app's isolated storage :D

      Google also made pacman in Google Maps this year :D
      and in one of the previous years they made way too much stuff, remember Google Translate for Pets? Officially switching names with some city keda for one day? Pokemon in Google Maps? Gmail body gestures thing?
      When talking about effort spent (wasted?) on April Fools, I think Google comes up first :D
