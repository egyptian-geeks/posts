    message: Added complexity is the main cost.. For a primary CPU cache system it's
      mandatory to include subsystems of routing tags to memory locations with virtual
      address translation.. So is for networking systems..

    message: "I've actually had a mini-discussion about this article with some colleagues
      before. My main point here was how sad it is that *most* local web startups
      never seen growth past the stage of the 2000's/2002's. \n\nEven ones who actually
      employ newer solutions like nosql or custom memcaching, only do so because it's
      trendy and it's how the cool guys out there do it. Not because they've actually
      went through the growth pains or had the load that would justify the added complexity."

      cache for 1min. \n\nIt can reduce your application cost and overload so Yes
      it's the new RAM."

      is that you get to see multiple tech cycles beginning to end. You get to see
