      قبل كدا إنما أكيد فيها صعوبات، الأحسن والأسهل تكون سيرفر-سايد.

    message: "Mohamed El Sayed the Canvas only work if you have your html online normal.
      in my case i'm loading a scaled iframe and i want to generate a screenshot from
      this iFrame. \n\nI tried most of the services that exist and so far the best
      wa url2png but they have a HUGEEE delay in their API response other services
      cause issues with fonts rendering.\n\nJS Solutions like PhantomJS failed big
      time. I also tried Flash and Flex. My only solution now is to use Java. I think
      this is the only way left.\n\nIt's really amazing how all the screenshots services
      SUCKS and they are so fuckin Expensive and the cheap ones give you a very small
      API calls per day.\n\nThe problem in my case is that the iFrame contents change
      every time you refresh the page so i can't use a service and cache the screenshot
      image :S and i can't load too many iframes on the same page because it will
      cause memory leaks in browser and my target browsers are (IE9+, Chrome latest
      and FF Latest)."

    message: Did you try loading the iframe in a SVG foreignObject then using the
      SVG as an image and draw it on a canvas then take a photo of the canvas? But
      anyway why don't you make your own server-side solution? it will be very much
      easier that all this
