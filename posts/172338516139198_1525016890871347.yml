      What exactly do you want to work on?
      Just work in a normal company as a front-end developer?
      Build things like Reactjs?

      Sorry, whoever suggested you don't need math or zero math, is basically misguiding you

      always be the ultimate goal not what you think you'll be able to do with it.
      And that's always the key to mastering any new skill in general.
