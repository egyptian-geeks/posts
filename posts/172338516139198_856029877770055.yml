message: "Howdy geeks ..\n\nI have been thinking about a good introductory paragraph
  entry to start with , but i wasn't satisfied with any of the entries i came up with
  so i decided not to waste your time and get straight to the point .. \n\nAm not
  sure if such a post fits in this group or not , but i will really appreciate ur
  help.\n\nCurrently am in the 3rd grade in the Faculty of Computers and information
  system - Assuit university , and i have been struggling for a while trying to determine
  what specific field should i focus on and what specific skills should i enhance
  to land a job ASAP (Which is at least as soon as i graduate).\n\nI have already
  tried quite some stuff , Lead the first team to join the ACM-ACPC annual contest
  from my university , We did pretty well as no training was provided , We were totally
  self-dependent (We beat the AUC,GUC beginners team though , Am sure we could have
  done better).\n\nAnyways i have also tried to get my hands dirty working with some
  technologies , developed some java desktop applications , did some Web-Development
  in native php also used some micro-frameworks and worked a lil with (codeigniter
  and laravel) , Thanks to Alaa as he truly helped me a lot.\n\nUsing technologies
  is fun when everything works out pretty well , but it's pretty boring compared to
  abstract problem solving , specially optimization problems and AI..\n\nCurrently
  am getting used to the .NET framework , Working on a timetabling software for my
  faculty's semester timetables , In which am learning new AI techniques that i wasn't
  familiar with before (Ant colony optimization - Genetic algorithms - Graph coloring
  etc .. ) and also learning more about the .NET framework and C# (as i have chosen
  it to be the language am using for developing application for the .NET framework)
  .\n\nSo the problem is i really almost got no clue about what are the requirements
  of current employers and what should i do to land a job more quickly , Specially
  landing a job that isn't boring that it's only about implementing stuff for a specific
  framework or platform with no much thinking or problem solving involved , it would
  be just about getting used to that specific technology and acquiring more knowledge
  about flaws that might occur and bugs/problems that might show up later , Which
  is quite boring i guess. \n\nI really want to describe the position where am currently
  standing right now so you guys could provide the most efficient tips , but i guess
  that won't be easy right , Also i don't want to waste your time anymore ..\n\nSo
  in a nutshell what do you guys think i should be doing for the next couple of years
  before graduating taking in consideration that i might want to land an internship
  next summer , Thanks A LOT in advance , I totally totally appreciate your help ,
  Sorry again for wasting your time."

      the most important thing that I advise myself a lot, and it's helpful for you
      I think, keep going and don't get frustrated or bored at any point till you
      reach the \"BEGIN\" of your dream road. The climate which we live in now is
      extremely frustrating and boring and it may lead you to  give up and live as
      a normal employee with 1,000 or 2,000 E.P/month. \n\nI wait impatiently to meet
      you my friend ^_^"

    message: Once you finish step 1, i.e. you can develop web applications, do data
      driven stuff and some client side tricks (not necessarily MVC), then do SharePoint
      development (1 year web dev + EF for data), then do 1 year of SP. After that
      I suggest you keep your saw sharp in your spare time with some Python and do
      a some algoroithm courses on coursera, and make sure you speak and write english
      in at least intermeddiate level  (not the c.v. level you write for employers,
      the real one). Also keep listening to tech podcasts and reading tech journals.
      in 3 years after a few projects under your belt and some cool new buzzwords,
      apply for jobs in US and Australian companies and whether you make it or not
      in the exams keep going to gain more experience until you can work for a foriegn
      company overseas. Please note the companies here are mainly a weak imitation
      of what they have overseas. So 2-4 years is more than enough if you focus to
      make it to the real thing. Also, try to gain an understanding of Agile and working
      in small teams in an Agile environment. But what will make you really employable
      and help you keep a job is you productivity in a specific technology.

      Possibly do some projects on oDesk on the side if you have the time, to gain
      some time management and customer facing expeience cause most companies don't
      give you that the first few years

    message: I think if we actually knwo that as developers we can work anyshere in
      the world this will increase the employer competition for the good resources
      and also it will opne up fields for us all over the world. The biggest problem
      I have seen making some very smart people unemployable or decrease their chances
      in the Intl job market is lack of language skills, specially English. If you
      can speak frensh btw and are mediocre technically or German you have a much
      higher chance of landing a tech job at a multinational than you do if you were
      a tech genuis with no language skills. Also try to build your own web site to
      showcase your skills especially if you are a front end guy.

      blogger, send them an email, they are usually very helpful and they usually
      have great advice for you. Don't bug them with a million emails, but keep a
      nice connection with them. You can also reach almost anyone within Microsoft
      or Google. Just look for their blogs. Look at the blog of the development team
      of the product you are following to know things early. Follow the international
      conference streams like the Agile conferences and MS tech conferences and Pycon.
