  I know this is a very diverse group.
  But here goes nothing. Hackers are geeks to aren't they?

  So I am on a domain (have a domain user) and have it's SID and everything. I have the metasploit MS14_068 Kerberos checksum exploit that is supposed to elevate me to  domain admin (right?)

  What are other ways to do that? Post exploitation would be using mimikatz and trying to dump users hash passwords (after maybe getting access to the domain controller? Which is 2012 R2)

  Can someone help in exploiting a domain admin account when having a domain user.

      As at any point of time we can't tell the difference between a user that is pentesting and another user who just want to hack a network for illegal purposes, I refuse to have this kind of posts here.
      I'll stop commenting on this post.
