      I wasn't sure where to start, and was thinking about how long my reply will be, but if you understand why SASS, you understand why LESS. They do the same thing.

      LESS was popular especially for .NET devs and for early Node devs when SASS was only a Ruby thing. Even SCSS didn't exist back in the days, and although I didn't check the exact history, I'd expect that  LESS helped greatly make SCSSS become the thing.

      I wouldn't use LESS now. Not because it's bad, but because SASS (SCSS) is better. But I'd used LESS a lot years back when SASS was too not as accessible to me as .NET developer.

      Rhino) or client-side (modern browsers only).
