  Guys, I'm planning to suggest a plan for a company about what online resources should they subscribe to, in order to have always-ready, well-crafted resources for the developers in the company. my initial suggestion is consists of 2 services:
  1- Pluralsight subscription plus: http://www.pluralsight.com/training
  2- Safari Books online: http://my.safaribooksonline.com/

  What do you think? can you suggest better alternatives ?
  Do you have any other recommendations?

  Waiting for your reply, and thanks in advance :)

  Mohammed Hossam, Mohamed Meligy, Adel K. Khalil  kindly advice :)

      Still prefer hard copies, they should create a library at the office and buy some software engineering books.

      At my job we do a technical sessions every now and then i know this is not exactly what you are asking for but still this would make them sharp.

      I totally agree with the technical sessions idea, and this is in the list by the way ;)
      regarding hard copies, this can be by side with the top suggestions, cause we need a way to be up-to-date with the new tools, and hard copies are useful, but cannot be the only source of learning.

      Yep i am very well aware of Plural-sight their library is impressive, teckpub is somehow a one man show (Rob Conery from SubSonic fame) but it definitely has some good videos.

      You won't find any other website close to Plural-sight :) but Tekpub is a good addition not replacement.

      Also you can check www.dnrtv.com it's free have many great videos but it's updated like every couple of months.

      I've just checked AppDev (now called LearnPlusNow), they are amazing!!
      they are the closest to Pluralsight so far, if not better in some topics.
      they provide hands-on labs, code samples, and other neat features.

      I've a slightly different suggestion: hold a hackathon, let them create a project from scratch, and launch it to the public, and continue working on it in their spare time. This will achieve the following benefits

      1. They will do something of their own, not something forced upon them by the management or the client
      2. They have control (& responsibility) of this project.
      3. They will learn more about software development: brainstorming, good planning, using the best tools for the job, etc
      4. If the ideas are good, they will live. If the ideas are not good, or the people are lazy to keep it alive, these projects will die. Other people will ask why this happened, they will learn how to keep a software project living
      5. It will raise their morale
      6. Beware that this may suck them from other corporate responsibilities. You need to learn how to convince them to balance their time

      Mohammad Tayseer: I doubt that this can work in most of the companies that I'm aware of :S
      I really like this approach, but unfortunately, I think it's not achievable except for a few cases.
      ناس متجوزين ومخلفين وفى مواصلات وطريق وعاوزين يروحوا ويشتغلوا كمان فى العمل الخاص لو عندهم, من الصعب إنهم يجتمعوا على حاجه زى كدا.

    message: the nice thing about Pluralsight videos is that they don't assume geekiness.
      I have seen them working in moving some Indian teams that the customer wasn't
      sure about their competitiveness into doing nice stuff like client-side-heavy
      Single Page Applications. Very similar to what you are describing.
