message: "Today Reading: \n\nSoftware developers don’t really like to make schedules.
  Usually, they try to get away without one. “It’ll be done when it’s done!” they
  say, expecting that such a brave, funny zinger will reduce their boss to a fit of
  giggles, and in the ensuing joviality, the schedule will be forgotten.\n\nMost of
  the schedules you do see are halfhearted attempts. They’re stored on a file share
  somewhere and completely forgotten. When these teams ship, two years late, that
  weird guy with the file cabinet in his office brings the old printout to the post
  mortem, and everyone has a good laugh. “Hey look! We allowed two weeks for rewriting
  from scratch in Ruby!”"
