    message: Lol i can't believe they built it on Wordpress, hahah and he claims to
      be in the software business for some time... Charging 9k per member and still
      not custom building it. WP is becoming very insecure as well. i givem 4 months
      till they get hacked

    message: yeah many things created this days same concept for rich ppl. like the
      app in store cost $1000 and the app is only say this a proof you're rich. nothing
      else. just to be showy. I don't know what the point becuz most of rich ppl are
      not dumb and this the reason their become rich unless who buying these stuff
      are spoiled rich kids
