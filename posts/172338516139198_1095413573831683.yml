  Hello,
  I wrote this C implementation of the quick sort algorithm today. It works most of the time but sometimes I find a relatively small number embedded between two big ones..
  I believe there's something wrong in one very specific case, but I can't really figure it out.
  Please check out the code and tell me if you find out something.
  Thanks in advance.

      Thanks alot, it works now :D
      I know that using pointers wasn't a good idea. I haven't coded in C for about 6 months and I needed to have a quick revision on the syntax, pointers,etc ... so I challenged myself to implement that algorithm using pointers only :D
