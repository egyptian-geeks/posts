    message: It's worth mentioning that they weren't the first to achieve this. A
      few weeks ago the BlueOrigin landed vertically after take off. The astonishing
      part of the Falcon 9 launch, though, is that it rose for a much higher altitude
      (almost double BlueOrigin's altitude), and the rocket itself is twice as long
      as BlueOrigin. A historic moment in space flight, for sure.
