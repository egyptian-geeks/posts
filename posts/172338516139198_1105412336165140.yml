  During my quest to make better use of my time, i started listening to podcasts a couple of months ago and that really helped me save time and make use of otherwise wasted time, so i wrote a blog post about some of my favorite podcasts.

  In the blog post i wrote short description about each podcast along with average duration of episodes, podcast website, and direct RSS feed URL to add to your podcast app.

  =========================
  The tl;dr version:
  PHP-related Podcasts
  - /dev/hell
  - PHP Town Hall
  Laravel-related Podcasts
  - Laravel News
  - The Laravel Podcast
  Linux-related Podcasts
  - LINUX Unplugged
  - The Linux Action Show
  =========================

  This is the first part, i'll write another post about podcasts concerned with security and software development in general.

      I like listening to Hanselminutes (by Scott Hanselman) while driving from Cairo to Alex and back, it's not technical, but it's informative and fun :)
      I don't think I could focus on podcasts when driving to and from work though, too much is happening on the road :\

      cool .. my 2 cents, these are mostly Bussiness/Freelancing Oriented
      #TheGentlyMad
      #TheSmarterFreelancing
      #ThoughtWorks (yes they have a podcast)
      #AgileForHumans
