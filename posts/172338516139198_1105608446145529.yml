message: "Geeks,\n\nOut of mere curiosity, I'd like to know your thoughts on the Apple
  iOS backdoor story. \n\nI personally think it's purely a trust building feat more
  than anything else. Especially because most of the companies that backed Apple in
  the backdoor issue, are involved in PRISM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)
  - Microsoft, Fb, and Google were among the first to back Apple's position against
  the FBI, and they're all in there, including Apple of course.\n\nI understand that
  a backdoor would be a whole other level of wtf, but I would still not be very trusting
  of them from a privacy POV, if at all.\n\nThoughts?"
