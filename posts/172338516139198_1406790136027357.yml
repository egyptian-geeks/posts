message: "Hi Geeks \nI need this answer ASAP please it is urgent, \nI want to create
  back-end service broadcast data in real time to number of user listens to it.\nThe
  back-end service also collect its  data from other servers in real time.\nWhat is
  technology should i use to make data real time between my-service, front-end users
  and other servers which have data. \n\nafter search i found that socket is good
  choice.\nIs Socket will be valid in this scenario ? \nIs there any better protocol
  ?  \n#Thanks"

    message: "Sockets is very low level you will need to deal with a lot of details
      you maybe don't need it\nYou can think of queue based message passing or may
      be more elegant puplish/subscribe techniques \nIf you can describe it in more
      detail we  can then go more clear into a good fit solution"

    message: you need some implementation of publish/subscribe pattern .. some servers
      publishes and others listen, you can use any technology to implement that ...
      you can use real time database like firebase, or using sockets and back it up
      with something like redis pubsub, or you can use channels in asp signalR but
      you then going to implement some apis to be able to push data ... or you might
      some other online service ... if your app is all like this you might think about
      switching to event driven architecture
