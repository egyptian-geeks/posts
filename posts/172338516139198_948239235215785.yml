      The moment I saw the first screenshot I figured out most of it :D
      Below the title of every search result is the link to where it is found (google searches both the page contents and it's URL), and his URL was a link to a google search for his username "ssabereltony".
      So it seems that google return a search result which is a search page (play inception sound), but how did google thing that this guy's page has a URL that is google search page?
      I solved the mystery when I read that on his Google+ page he wrote his website url to be this google search page (he change that now BTW), so google probably makes use of the data on google+ to know people's website and add it to its index, which means ... Google accidentally indexed itself, that's why its rank was so high :D
