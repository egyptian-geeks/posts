      I don't know whether I understood the question correctly or not, but I'll answer the "what's the importance of creating a personal technical blog" question. Sorry if that's not what you are asking about.
      For me, it's the motivation you get from the community. I love it when I publish a post and keep staring at google analytic's realtime metrics. I love it when people start liking or sharing the posts I write. But more importantly, you'll get feedback. Usually it's a valuable one. I wrote a post about what I think of Go, when I published the post I got a comment telling me about a feature that I was missing in Go. The last post I wrote, someone told me that there's a race condition in my code. He told me how to detect and fix it. So, it's a win win. You get motivated, learn new things and at the same time you share some of the knowledge you have.
