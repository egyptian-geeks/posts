  Why should we use #React_Redux  over #Angular ? the idea of #reusable_component and #one_store of data can be done in angular if needed with Directive or Services . the #Angular problem of watchers and  2 way data binding performance can be ignored by dynamic rendering   and dispatch  actions to update models .
  I am interested to know more information from any expert  here

      Well, directives are no match for react components, also react will outperform angular1.x in any midum+ size project.
      - also react is cross platform: server side rendering if u care about seo, react-native for native like mobile apps.
      One more thing i migrated from angular to react for was bundle size. When our project was using angular the lib.js file alone was 1MB++ compared to 200k for react and i wasnt even using jquery ! Angular2 bundle size is even twice that size.
