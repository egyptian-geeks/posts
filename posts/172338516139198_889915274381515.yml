    message: online in egypt ! i don't think u can in a direct way but there are some
      work around  "i didn't personally try " use a web site called khamsat or another
      way to have pioneer account. or throw international banks like HSBC.

    message: Western Union is probably the fastest since you don't need to setup an
      account with the service or even have a bank account. You just tell the sender
      your name and which WU branch you will pickup from. I know 2 branches that are
      20 mins away from my home and I live in 6th of October.

    message: Thanks guys actually am using Western Union already, the only issue is
      that the very high fees, so of you are collecting small amounts it will be very
      big cut.
