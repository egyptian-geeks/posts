      from other networks you don't use? You want to block all mobile use? Or what?

    message: aluminum foil paper, but take care cause it would actually isolate you
      from outer world i.e. it would absorb any electromagnetic radiation including
      the ones used by your cell operator :D

    message: you can test it by wrapping your phone with it then trying to call it,
      it will be out of coverage  :)

    message: how to apply the foil paper without getting an image that strengthen
      the signal  (image theory used in antennas ) , and how to apply it to a decoration
      (already built house )

    message: yes basically it would work like a very large antenna that would absorb
      any electromagnetic radiation, you can simply get rid of the accumulated charge
      by grounding it :) For decoration, I'm not an expert in this field so you use
      your imagination :D maybe attach it to the walls then spray it with any paint,
      it will look like as if you are living in a space ship :P

    message: another thing, did you check the building structure? i.e. the amount
      of steel used in the roofs? it have the same effect that's why you get bad reception
      in bathrooms for example because they use more steel in bathrooms roofs..

    message: before you start investing in the solution, I guess you should verify
      that you have a problem in the first place, maybe you are already shielded or
      maybe the signal wattage is too low to do any harm..

    message: theoretically the distance between the cell tower and building is more
      than safe according to law, but does not mean that the towers operate at legal
      power ranges, and the building's residence think other wise, after couple of
      years long exposure is has its towe, so a solution will put them into a good  psychological
      state of mind.

    message: well, instead of subjective residents opinion, invest in some objective
      measurements, at least by then you will have a case that no one can debunk by
      simple bullshit talk..

    message: "I've once read some article online explaining that EM radiation coming
      out of a neon lamp or a plasma TV far more exceeds in terms of wattage the ones
      you are actually receiving from cell towers.. \n\nAlso if this would make you
      more comfortable the idea of cellular networks is it have several cells in order
      to reuse a certain band of frequencies and these cells gets smaller in congested
      areas like in Cairo for example so they can't use high amplification wattage
      otherwise they will interfere with nearby cells from the same operator that
      happens to be reusing the same wave frequency.. so even if the country laws
      allows it, the technology it self won't make it possible to use extremely high
      wattage specially in Cairo since the cells are very small compared to other
      areas.."

    message: after all, don't take my word for it, just take actual measures instead
      of guessing or using some anecdotal evidence.. in the end, being worried and
      stressed could be much more dangerous to your health than the EM radiation you
      are worried about that you would be actually associating its symptoms to the
      towers wrongfully..
