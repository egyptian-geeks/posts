      out its enterprise IT portfolio: today the company announced that it would buy
      Ansible, an IT automation solutions specialist that helps companies build and
      manage hybrid IT deployments across the cloud and on-premise solutions.The acquisition
      had been rumored to be in the works for a price of over $100 million. Officially,

      of the deal, which should close this month.Ansible, based out of Santa Barbara

      has made a name for itself as a specialist in OpenStack clouds -- earlier this
      year it spearheaded a partnership with Cisco, HP, CSC and RackSpace in aid of
      this. Red Hat''s acquisition of Ansible is the company''s signal of how it hopes
      to expand further into OpenStack itself, ...'
