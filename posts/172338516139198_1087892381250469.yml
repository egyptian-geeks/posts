  I have an idea. There are lots of cool and interesting tech people to follow on twitter, blogs .. etc. Why don't we share some of those accounts with a small summary of who they are and what do they usually tweet about. Maybe we can find some interesting people to follow.
  As an example I'd start by:

  - @chrishunt : A github engineer, one of the best speakers I've ever seen. I started using tmux after watching one of his talks. His podcast is nice also. Other than tech, he has some talks on memory and solving rubik's cubes. Watch his talks.

  - @Nick_Craver : A stackoverflow developer and sys admin. I've mentioned him before. He tweets a lot about SO's architecture and stats and he's currently writing a series of blog posts about SO's architecture, hardware, .. ( https://trello.com/b/0zgQjktX/blog-post-queue-for-stack-overflow-topics ).

  - @fatih : Software Engineer at Digital Ocean and the developer of the famous vim-go plugin. Most of his tweets are about Go.

  - @antirez : The creator of redis.

  Those are the people I have in mind right now. Whenever I remember someone new I'll add him in a comment.

      I like this idea :D
      I've been following @JSonmez for some time he doesn't tweet or blog about software very often, he usually blogs about skills software developers need to advance in their career.
