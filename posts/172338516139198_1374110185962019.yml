      negotiable with no up or down limits
      also depends on many factors such as:
      1- project nature... if it is a tailored solution specifically designed for the customer, then you can start from 20% up to 100% ... if it is a one of your flag products that you sell then you can start from 500% up to 1000% if you like ... no limits in this case
      2- level and quality of code documentation...
      there are no rules or specific answer for your question... put assumptions and hypothesis to have a wide range in your negotiation

    message: I was thinking about this matter today, I don't understand how this works.
      So, do you usually give the client a minified version of the code?

      you give he client the source code. I am not criticising, I just don't get it.

      to be able to reuse the code or resell it etc.

    message: "+1 to Meligy's answer. \nA. If you were hired as a freelancer/contractor
      to build something \"for\" the client, then the intellectual property: the product,
      design, code, etc.. is theirs and not yours. Client is paying for your working
      hours, so anything coming out of those working hours, technically the client
      owns. \nThat's the convention I know of, so unless otherwise agreed, you generally
      need THEIR permission to reuse the solution/sell it and not the other way around.\n\nB.
      If it was \"your\" product or service in the first place and you're just selling
      / providing them with version of it, customized or not, then it's your property
      and can negotiate selling it at a price.\nCase B could also apply to a \"part\"
      of the product you're building for  the client, so let's say some core library/module
      you have already built in the past (on your own time) that will be included
      in your end solution. This isn't owned by the client because they didn't pay
      you to build it, so that's basically the rule of thumb"
