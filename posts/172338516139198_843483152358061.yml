      final product? How is the experience compared to current capabilities of MS
      Word like making sure you only use defined styles so you can change them globally

      \ .. another interesting site is https://www.writelatex.com/  \nas I told before
      equations are the most powerful thing in latex  .. and ofcourse all publishing
      companies are using it."

      We are sometimes forced in GUC to use LaTeX for various project reports and when writing our Thesis.
      You can think of LaTeX like Markdown but for scientists instead of developers, it's a syntax that can be processed into PDF (or maybe other formats, I'm not sure). Lyx can be thought of as MarkdownPad for LaTeX.
      I've used Lyx because I didn't really want to learn the syntax of LaTeX and did want to use commands or an eclipse plugin to render/export what I wrote to PDF or whatever.

    message: It easier to write mathematical equations in LaTex than any other word
      processing but I don't recommend it if your content does not contains equations
      or only very simple ones. In LaTex you write something similar to HTML and then
      compile it to output PDF at the end.
