  Genuine post from me Mohamed Samy and not some spam or clickbait ad.

  For those learning Python/Django and if you want to create your environement on the cloud for free. This site provides a free dev environment. It also works for Ruby on Rails, Node.js, GO, PHP and Meteor.

  You also get an editor in the cloud which is very sublime like.

  If you use this link you get an extra 250 MB of storage and I get some extra room for my free VM too https://www.nitrous.io/join/8VJgm-zW4I4?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral

    message: Emad Mokhtar Habib this has more storage and CPU power as far as I can
      see. Also, It desn't come with a Python/Django virtual environment, and you
      can't refer people to get more space and RAM.
