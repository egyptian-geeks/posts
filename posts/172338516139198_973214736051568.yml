      Looking awesome!
      Can you talk to us a bit about the hiring process there? I talked to them but had a few weeks of pneumonia after initial interviews and never got to check the tests or follow up with them after that.

    message: "Mohamed, the hiring process is tough but straightforward:\n\n1- First
      a screening interview, to verify your application and make sure you speak proper
      English, etc. Nothing technical at this stage. \n\n2- Then you are given an
      online test; three programming problem that you are required to solve in 90
      minutes. This one is tough, but you are not expected to get a full score, they
      are rather testing your \"problem solving abilities\".\n\n3- The next step is
      an online interview, through which they will review your test result and require
      you to solve two more problems with them over-watching/discussing it with you.\n\n4-
      The final step is an assignment, usually one week long (two if it is specially
      hard). The assignment differs according to how you define your expected position
      (frontend, backend, mobile, etc.). This assignment will be heavily inspected
      for design and code style.\n\n5- After that, congratulation, you are one of
      the best 3% developers in the word, as per Toptal advertisement :D"

    message: Aha. Quite similar to Readify's process (a test that's now automated,
      HR interview, tech interview with live debugging test), where we used to call
      it top 5-10% of the world, except we stopped using that wording because 'how
      can you tell? How can anyone even measure that?)
