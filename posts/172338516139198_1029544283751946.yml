message: "Hi guys , I just want to know your opinion regarding an idea that I have.\n\nProblem
  : Sometimes I fed up with Facebook (for productivity reasons) and I decide to kill
  the news feed or even close the account but at the same time I'm following a lot
  of great people who publish great beneficial posts and some groups/pages that share
  hot opportunities and excellent opinions.\n\nSuggested Solution :\n\nActually the
  idea isn't very clear yet but I'm thinking about :\n\nA tool that get all the feeds
  from your favorite sources (groups/pages/Persons) and exposes them through an alternative
  news feed. \n\nYou can apply some filters on the content so when a new post (from
  a page that you love) contains \"Master Degree Scholarship\" is posted , you will
  get notified.\n\nThe content may be pre-processed to remove for example all the
  politics posts :) in addition to a lot of other things.\n\nDo you also have the
  same problem ? What are your solutions for it ?\nDo you think you could use sth
  like that if it is free for example ?"

    message: I love the idea from a 10,000ft view. I think I'd definitely use it,
      because I personally struggle with that a lot. On IG, Twitter and Facebook.
      Would I pay for it? Yes, but how much? No clue, these kind of services always
      strike me as a perfect fit for a PWYW model.

      I solve this problem by avoiding the news feed completely and really only on notifications, I have a small list of friends where I get notified every time they post, and I make important groups notify me too.
      On the rare occasion that I'd like to waste some time, I go and check the news feed.

    message: Well, mainly Facebook newsfeed comes from the pages, people ad groups
      that you follow. You can simply like the pages, join the groups and add the
      people who you really want to see their updates

      Hi Ahmed,
      I already did this
      This is currently my 3rd week :)
      I unfollowed everyone and did unlike all of the pages I have
      I switched to Twitter where I have way more useful content and switched to RSS Readers as well to get content from my favourite places
      *I'm here to post something only and saw your post :)*
