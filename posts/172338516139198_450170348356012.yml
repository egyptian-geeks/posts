    message: as Mohamed Alaa said, this is enough but you need to use them in real
      life projects which will give you the experience which is the thing you can't
      get by reading books or doing small examples. After gaining that experience,
      you will be able to learn more languages much easier.

    message: you can even learn jquery with javascript cause both are indispensable
      in today's projects. Afterwards, you can learn C# which will give you the power
      of .net but keep in mind that you will need to learn many new concepts to use
      C# cause it's different from PHP even php now has object oriented features or
      so
