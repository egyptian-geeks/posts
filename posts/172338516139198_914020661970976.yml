    message: I was ok with JavaScript and I thought it's how frontend should be dealt
      with, until I learnt swift. JS is a mess and it needs to be re-considered.

      You should cover stuff like
      - prototypal inheritance
      - how functions are treated as first class citizens
      - how everything can act like an object
      - loose typing
