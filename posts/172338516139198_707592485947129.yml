      Adham EL-Deeb Windows version is coming. it;s actually a very good strategy for releasing to mac users first since they are very picky people. they give constructive critics. and think of it for a sec. if it works for Mac it would probably work  for Windows users and if it doesn't work for mac it's because it's useless and no one will like it.

      Mac Users are very hard judges that's how they do it.

      Ubuntu is insulting to the linux ecosystem, want some hardcore juice you hit slackware, gentoo or drop down to a unix. But I guess they just had to make some room for the rest of the world.
