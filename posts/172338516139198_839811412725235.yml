    message: Guys, I think what he is looking for is software developers (preferably
      seniors / leads) who are happy for him to interview them (not sure written interview
      or in person) about their experience applying agile in reality. He came to me
      asking and I thought our group sure has some people that can offer that help.
      Thanks.

      Yes, dr Fatma used to teach agile by practice in the GUC as part of the Software Engineering course :)
      Each tutorial group was like a company with a scrum master (the TA) and split into teams with team leaders, and she evaluated everything after every sprint :)

    message: "Ahmed Samir  are you targeting the agile specification or the adoption
      in the business world...  \n\nFew years ago we have been exploring different
      forms of Agile. and then we build own customized version of the Scum process.
      basically it is scrum with some additional guidelines to cope with business
      needs."

    message: I think this sort of customisations is exactly what he would like to
      know. What you followed by the book and worked, and what you didn't follow and
      why, and what you followed and failed, and what you added to it (the customisation).
      This sounds like a great example. Allow Ahmed to contact you about it please.
