  my very bad experience with RackSpace, once you open an official account with them, they will get you charged even for nothing
  AVOID them unless you really know how to play with them

      If they're not refunding and you're in for a fight, issue a transaction dispute at your bank. Request a charge back, displaying evidence of misconduct on their behalf.

      That's if you have such evidence... but if they've explicitly explained or even hinted at the possibility of being charged as per your current balance then you're shit out of luck.
