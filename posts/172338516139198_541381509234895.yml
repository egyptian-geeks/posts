    message: nop coz i had the chance to do some work for them. but i think from now
      they should start planning for something. and killing Google Reader in June
      is a good chance to come with an alternative. also i think google will release
      Google reader as an open source.

      This was a reply from feedly on a question about the dependency of Google Reader account:
       (When you connect to Google, we create a feedly account automatically which maps to that Google Account. When Google Reader is retired in July 1st, you will be able to continue to login with you Google Account, the only different is that the content you will see in your feedly will be aggregate by a feedly server call Normandy.)
