  in python web development,
  is PSP(python server pages) deprecated ?!
  if yes, what is the way to dynamically send parameters to .html pages?
  thanks in advance;

      I have never heard of python server pages until now.

      What you're looking for is a templating language

      https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating

      I recommend using Jinja2

    message: If you are using django they have their own templating language, which
      is really easy to use and its syntax is very similar to Jinja2 (if you don't
      use Django).
