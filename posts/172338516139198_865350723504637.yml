    message: Looks nice. A small feedback; the images in the beginning of each 'section'
      are a bit distracting, maybe you could fade them out or desaturate the colors
      a bit.

    message: what are the skill percentages out of? If they are skill mastery, how
      are you 98% at mastery of UI design? I don't know of a single person who'd qualify
      himself as a 100% master UI designer

      so, show, dont tell... and what does Git via terminal & source tree mean?

    message: Ali Helmy the percentage is out of my own scale ... which is what's the
      strongest and which is the weakest ... apps and toys refers to the tools that
      I've been using and it should be obvious from the listing below and my work
      is already on dribbble ... the Git part means that I use it with the mentioned
      tools ... thanks for your feedback :)

    message: Hmmmm... Out of your own scale is a little subjective, no? Personally,
      if I were looking to hire you, I'd find it a bit confusing at best, and self-catering
      at worst :)

      1- Remove the "Books I've read" section. You will get a "You read only 4 books?" response all the time
      2- The design looks pretty & I like it, but I believe that you can show more info with less scrolling. This is a CV at the end & it will be printed for interviews
      3- I believe that you should put the work experience at the top, just after your personal info. Tools should be part of the job description, e.g. "Web & mobile UI / UX design, using Balsamiq & Photoshop"
      4- Separate different activities for a project in bullet points
      5- Use numbers to show how much you enhanced the project, e.g. "Enhanced the UX of website XYZ to increase revenues by 15%", or the number of people who use your product, etc
      6- Link to images to your designs (if possible)
