message: "I think most of you are following what Microsoft is doing nowadays. Just
  a small advise for the aspnet developers, you may start reading about the new changes

  bower, grant... ). \nIf you are full stack developer (you are writing all the layers
  including front end) if you don't already, you may read about client frameworks
  like angularjs and react..."
