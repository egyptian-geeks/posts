      IMHO, learning a field such as Machine learning, Data science, Image processing, is forced by one of the following reasons:
      - Developer intrinsic motivation to learn and explore new areas and ideas
      - Your current job needs, like a new project or a new feature that require it
      Also learning even the basics of some of these fields is so useful, it can inspire you with more ideas, solutions, side projects.
      if you're talking to another developer discussing a problem and he suggested a solution inspired from his readings in data mining for example, I would be very impressed as a peer.
      - For me being in this career means to continue learning and exploring, it's not a burden it's just interesting to know new stuff, and I advise you to think of it this way.

      worth to continue then why not? .. if get bored turn to another field and have
      a good idea about it ... at the end of the day you have a wide knowledge and
      you don't spend much time in somthing you would not use again ... just a good
      understand which will be very useful.
