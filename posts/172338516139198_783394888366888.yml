      Ahmed Kamal You mentioned building his own crawler and making his own spider etc.. without asking if they have the following:

      1. A good budget to sustain the business.
      2. A good servers that will be crawling and exporting whatever they find in the database.
      3. if they already have an Algorithm to crawl and get the exact information they need or they will crawl whatever data!

      Most of the good news website has APIs or RSS Feeds so if you want to make a crawler is because you want special cases website and I don't think he will need to crawl a website.

      Last thing as you said he can get blocked, so why to do it the wrong way of he only can do it the correct way without getting blocked at all!

      First I mentioned the need for a dedicated server or cloud service in addition to parsers to build a good crawler :)

      I also mentioned the reason why I prefer them in my comment , RSS feeds are very limited and if he is going to build a large news aggregator  with different features then he shouldn't depend on RSS.  RSS is suitable for a mobile app version of a website or simple news aggregator imo.

      And using reoccurring (15 to 30 minutes) service to collect number of shares you will know when people share.

      You can also integrate with something like weather to know under what condition people read news, also integrating with something like Waslny and By2olk can help a lot.

      At the end all this stuff are factors that directly effect people and their actions, and using simple math (Regression) you can tell what's next because human are highly predictable.
