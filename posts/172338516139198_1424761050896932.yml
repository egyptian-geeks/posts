      يعني ايه foo.x؟
      يعني عندك خاصية Property للكائن object اللي اسمه foo  اسمها x. والواقع بيقول من الكود بتاعك إن الكائن ده موش اتعرف له خاصية اسمها x.

    message: "That is because you are trying to attach a new property \"x\" to the
      \"foo\" object, you see when you do that it will will start with it first, as
      the member access or \".\" [check the member access in Operator precedence]
      is executed left to right, so what is happening now is as folows\nCreate object
      \"foo\"\nPass a reference from \"foo\" to \"bar\"\nCreate a new member in the
      \"foo\" object and call it \"x\"\nCreate a new object \"{n: 2}\"\nAssign that
      new object to \"foo\"\n\nand by doing so the \"x\" object is no longer there\nHope
      that answered your question:) \nref:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence"

      It is right to left.
      We can prove it by changing the targets to properties so that we can console log when they are called
      http://jsbin.com/viyavohuge/1/edit?js,console
      (Choose ES/Babel and Console tabs if not opened by default)

      It's just that the targets of assignments are determined BEFORE assignment. That's the whole thing.
