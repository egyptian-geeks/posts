  An interesting discussion on HN is taking place over HipChat's new terms of service. The argument is around account owners (namely company management) gaining access to private 1-on-1 chats. Some argue against it [0], some argue for it [1][2].
  Both of which are making very compelling cases, the policy is standard in almost all communication policies in corporate environments, likely the most common reason for the lack of such policy in startups is the legal overhead to produce, maintain and enforce one (despite what an entrepreneur might actually say, making a case that we're a startup and we do things differently)

      And seems like someone made a list of alternatives, quite interesting as well.

    message: "In most cases you shouldn't assume privacy in corporates. Not only because
      the company might be reading because sometimes they aren't, but because of the
      company goes under any legal problems all records will be exposed to the investigators
      including chat history, emails...etc \nIf you want to discuss something off
      records, say it in personal outside of the corporate premises."
