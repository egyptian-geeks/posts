  An interesting discussion on HN is taking place over HipChat's new terms of service. The argument is around account owners (namely company management) gaining access to private 1-on-1 chats. Some argue against it [0], some argue for it [1][2].
  Both of which are making very compelling cases, the policy is standard in almost all communication policies in corporate environments, likely the most common reason for the lack of such policy in startups is the legal overhead to produce, maintain and enforce one (despite what an entrepreneur might actually say, making a case that we're a startup and we do things differently)
