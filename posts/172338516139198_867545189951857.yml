    message: A landing page is one way to validate the idea. A funding campaign is
      another way. A session about the product is a 3rd way. All of these are good,
      but they are not the product.

      Whenever you read things like "in one day", expect it to be blah.
      There is a massive online business of products sold to those who want to make an online business.
      Every advice or freebie you get is probably just a way to get you to buy something (which may not be worth buying, and may still be worth)

      constantly abuzz. New marketing ideas, new projects, new problems, new content.
      It’s terribly exciting, and a little too easy to get sucked into a rabbit hole.
      So, I’ve started chanting a new mantra. One that will keep me from fiddling…
