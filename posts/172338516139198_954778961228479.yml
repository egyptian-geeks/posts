  Let's discuss this:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  CAN YOU BE A SENIOR IN YOUR FIELD WITHOUT HANDS ON EXPERIENCE?
  ___________________________________________________

  I will answer my own question just as an opinion: YES! (I know its odd but it happened!)
  Two years ago, A colleague  was interviewing some developers for a senior position, and one had satisfied and met all the requirements.
  He didn't hide his shallow hands on experience weakness, but rather than that, he was perfect in all other aspects. He even challenged us if we can come up with a technical issue he cannot solve, we've thoroughly tested him in the following:
  * Oveloading, Overriding, Constructors and Destructors.
  * Static VS Object properties and methods.
  * Magic Methods __get() and __set()
  * SQL injections
  * Security best practice for accessing and retrieving data from DB.
  * DB Shriding Techniques.
  * Clustering ..
  * Cloud Computing
  * SOAP VS REST
  * Case studies.
  * Decision making.
  * Implementation Scheduling.
  * Client handling.

  .... These are what I can recall now....

  We've end up with a developer that only needs more life scenarios to be fully qualified for the position...
  Actually I was hesitating to give him the position, but the decision wasn't mine.
  However, he got it ... and he showed some serious developing skills ...
  His secret was just simple: He Never Stop Learning and Fetching New Area of Knowledge...
  So.. What do you think?

      Knowing the tech trivia doesn't make someone a Senior.
      Personally when I interview someone for senior position, I look for scars that s/he has over years of solving problems, which should result in having a deeper perspective on how you approach a problem.
      Also you are looking for some leadership aspects, your senior engineers have a responsibility of raising your team's technical level, not only build software.

      an affinity to learn specific topics more than others .. if you can reveal this
      talent during interview then you are lucky again .. I agree on the scars methodology
      mentioned above .. judging people is a difficult matter .. it is a biased process
      which depends on your amount of experience you already have. \nI think we should
      discuss what do you mean by hands on experience ??  \nto make it worse .. I
      didn't know some of the topics you've mentioned above :D"

      Simple answer is NO, a Senior position is simply a Junior position with real-life experience, it is not what you know about the theories or even lab-environment experience (where you gain by learning and simulating a client needs) that gives you the seniority, it is the real life problems and interactions with the business needs and other team members (for example, how would you solve a Git merge issue when you are the only commiter, or how to recover from one of your colleagues mistakes that breaks the build, or remember the first time you uncovered an issue in your runtime where you wrote your statements by book and they simply gave a wrong output).
      On the other hand, your example might be a natural talent that only needs very little experience to become a real-senior.

    message: Sorry if I'm about to burst your bubble.. but in the business world seniority
      is not about technical trivia or even hands on experience these things can be
      acquired easily in no time and any fresh grad can pick it up fast but that wouldn't
      make him a senior.. seniority is just a title to justify your pay check.. only
      in Egypt developers with 3 years of experience get that title.. companies will
      not be paying you large pay checks (that should be associated with the title)
      unless they are damn sure that you can generate cash flow and in order to do
      so lot's of factors are involved.. say your role in several large projects,
      customer facing experience, the ability to work on large critical projects and
      the experience of work with multinationals and different cultures.. being flexible
      and in same time able to drive situations.. understanding of the business..
      ability to understand concepts such as time to market and trading that off with
      a nice feature that is good to have but is considered as gold plating.. understanding
      the concept of project scope and how some tasks or certain vague technical design
      might lead to scope creep.. experience is important here so you can spot such
      things.. in the end of the day I always say we are not in the better code business,
      we are in the money making business.. this is something that several technical
      people never understand, blinded by their passion for code, they become bad
      team leads and managers when they get the promotion just because they wrote
      code long enough.. causing misery to joniur developers who would spend nights
      and week ends with no overtime or any sort of compensation just to be able to
      deliver the vague scope that the customer might just reject in the end making
      the whole company suffer financially and not be able to pay raises hire more
      hands to help or even sometimes not being able to pay salaries..

    message: My Answer is "No" Most of what you learn and define your experience is
      mostly based on Failure. Even Steve Jobs and Bill Gates they failed a lot to
      become who they are. May be your question is not the right question.
