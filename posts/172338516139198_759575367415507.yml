    message: "Read the policy. \n\nAll your posts are coming from hootsuite, they're
      about an hour apart and exactly the same on the Egyptian web designers group
      with the same time stamps.\n\nIf anything, it tells me two things, a) this is
      running a schedule b) you're showing no courtesy to the community here by actually
      taking the time and posting yourself something relevant.\n\nYou posted 4 posts,
      two of them creative design oriented and one is in the gray."

      Dear Hady Ahmed, I'm the founder of Egyptian Web Designer group, I'm also participating in one other secret group, and my own profile. I use HootSuite because it saves a lot of time instead of posted here, then here, then here.

      I'm working as a Senior Front End Engineer, kinda geek as well, but I admit some of the posts I made here are irrelevant somehow, since it's related to inspiration regards UI/UX,..etc However I thought this might be interesting :)

    message: "Geek, kinda geek (albeit I disapprove this term and the one next) or
      wannabe geek are all welcomed here. \nThis is a place for those with passion
      towards technology at large and software in specific.\n\nNonetheless the pattern
      is alarming and the policy is clear about auto posting. The reason it's there
      because this isn't a link sharing group, it's here for discussions, debates
      and questions.\n\nBe it around a link, a topic, an event or anything else is
      irrelevant,  only thing that should be relevant is the content :)\n\nAnyway,
      we're not in disagreement, like I mentioned earlier the pattern was alarming."
