      It's but it's very complicated. Depending on your output I use a wrapper library based on D3 called http://nvd3.org/ and if you are stuck with a request of linechart+zoom use http://dygraphs.com/

      let me know what is your objective so I can help you selecting the most near library based on your needs.

    message: if it's light charts then no need for high charts or D3 go for something
      simple like http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/ and it's based on Raphael so
      it won't be hard achieving the gauge style charts http://justgage.com/
