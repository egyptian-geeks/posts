  Does anyone out there actually write code that is interesting to them for a job? or is it all data entry applications and reports?

  I don't know about you, but the run of the mill data entry and reporting apps are extremely boring to me. What kind of things do you do at work that really excite you?

      Thanks ya Mohamed, It's a bit more than this. The challenge is to encourage them to learn continuously (increasing retention), and ensure they are learning right, actively not passively.
      Our approach is gamification with some metrics/indices to measure the progress.

      The job I'm currently undertaking as a freelancer is a web platform made specifically for medical people. What does it do? It loads multiple applications in an iFrame and logs in automatically, so that you would literally have everything you use in a single place.

      It's interesting because of the security workarounds implemented, and the security that we have to implement to secure such thing.

      But, to generally answer your question, yes. That's why entrepreneurship exists.

      I can tell you that I work on bla bla, but this won't solve your problem.

      When my job was boring, I started working on side projects which are interesting to me. You get to choose the project, technology, architecture, etc.

      I shared my experience with side projects in this session

      rule out the fact that everyday corporate work can get really boring. I believe
      there can be creative solutions for that and have applied them before in some
      places. On solution is to use frameworks or scaffolding that makes your task
      take less time. Another would be to use already existing software like and ERP.

      That's the reason why I think I'll always work in startups, that way I get to work on fancy projects that I would like to see in people's hands.
      It's also why I always try to be working on a small game as a side project and wish I could make games full-time :)
