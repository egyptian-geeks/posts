    message: well so far printing your own stuff is usually more expensive than buying
      them, after all specialized things are more cost effective than general-purpose
      things.

    message: Amr Eldib think of another perspective, specialized parts that would
      have been imported from western companies can now be printed in the east. Think
      of Circuit boards and electronics, possibly machinery that is percision made.
      I can just imagine the chinese.

    message: Amr Eldib until we actually innovate and top copying Culturally first,
      then we can talk about innivation anywhere else, even our clothes are copied.
      As for blueprints, remeber the story of IBM compatibles? :0

    message: 10 years ago when I saw the first drone, I totally knew it could be done
      outside the US and totally expected them to be built here. Imagine Oil companies
      printing spare parts in the Gulf or printed car parts. No more money to Huyandai
      and buying faulty parts :)
