    message: "Well, in my personal experience, the issues started after DST expected
      time change with a week or so. I was able to confirm that they were related
      to pre-set set of IP addresses(adding a new IP to the same server \"solves\"
      the problem). And using a network sniffer I was able see that the packets dropped
      are the ones related to TLS negotiation, meaning it's not a routing issue, but
      more likely a DPI situation. \n\nI am only asking because this is the first
      initiative I saw to actually talk to/expose ISPs. So, wanted to make sure all
      the information is available.. \n\nThere were several posts about this with
      a great deal of information in the the past few weeks, you might be interested
      in looking them up."

    message: Well, some people claims it's a Deep packet inspection issue which could
      be true, but I can't get it why there's other similar websites, same region,
      same datacenter, same SSL certificates, but on different servers and it's working
      fine. So I'm not sure of the reason, and I haven't supplied a solution, it's
      just a simple way of diagnosis for normal users, and an encouragement to stress
      on ISPs to solve the problem whatever it's cause is.

    message: Mohamed El-Sayed By the way, if it's a DPI issue, is it related to the
      ISPs anyway? If not, is there any explanation why it's been solved for a period
      of time (almost a month), and then appeared again? I'm just asking to understand
      and know who we could talk to, or the way we look at for solutions..

    message: I was able to replicate the issue with multiple providers, so probably
      not on the ISP level. And I still have the same issues till now, it didn't go
      away :D

    message: I personally believe Egyptian ISPs could solve it since these issues
      appeared, and solved before (for multiple websites I own, and others I don't
      own), unless we’re facing here a situation where the government is playing with
      the DPI filters and can’t configure/use it!! :D
