  SA,
  I've been very interested in functional programming languages (Ex: Haskell), and I'm wondering why companies don't use it till now.
  I mean, it seems much more easier for me than imperative programming languages!

      pages/ apps then not very useful to use Haskell, but I guess you could use it
      to implement an Algorithm or create some type of analysis engine, or AI engine
