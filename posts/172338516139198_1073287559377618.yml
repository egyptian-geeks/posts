  "The wacky experiment was launched because current data centers are woefully inefficient. They're built where energy and land are cheap (not close to where people actually live). And they waste so much energy cooling their massive computers.

  The ocean can solve those problems. Ocean currents can produce enough energy to power the sub-sea data centers. The cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod. And since most people live near the ocean, placing data centers under water could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud."

      Even a dozen data centers will hardly affect the global temperature of the oceans, but we certainly have to think about how they will affect marine life.

      What I really wonder about is how they will maintain them, will they send diver engineers to replace failed drives and chips? :D
