    message: The fact that it's an android application doesn't make a difference,
      it all depends on what are you having there. Relational? Not relational? Scalable?
      Cheap? Huge community, small community? Takes a lot of resources, light? etc.

    message: It's relational and yes it will take a lot of resources, so can I use
      for example MySql and connect it to my android app?

    message: If you're not expecting a huge number of people, do that. It's better
      not to connect to the database directly, though. Create your own API.

    message: I do not think there's nothing called  "The best" , it should depend
      on the case you are in , you can start small taking scaleability into consideration

    message: If it's on the server, it doesn't matter. You probably want to encapsulate
      your logic in a web service or something and do all your security and application-specific
      features in there. Then the Android app just talks to your service regardless
      of what DB is behind it.
