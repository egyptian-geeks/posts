message: "Hello Guys, I need recommendations for a task/event/habit mangement app,
  \n\nto clear the scope I'm a full time backend developer and also a full time engineering
  student, so my day is full of tasks, events and assignments  I have to do and accomplish
  before deadlines, I use Jira in. My company, trello for freelance, but I need one
  for my personal life and my college life. \n\nright now I use 1-google calendar,
  2-asana and 3-mac calendar and zapeir  \"3rd party app which connect things together\"
  to connect my asana tasks with my google calendar , and all synced with my mac calendar
  \n\nMy mac calendar shows all the tasks from asana and google calendar perfectly
  * I love it! *, however it's on my mac and as I don't have an Iphone  phone I find
  myself checking G calendar and asana each time I want to know what's next to do,
  or what's next events\n\n-I use asana in adding and following up  tasks\n\n-I use
  Google calendar for it's killer feature where I can build  a skill * like read 10
  pages of  a book 3 times a week * and google calendar finds the free time where
  I can practice this skill and set reminders for me as well as keep following up
  with me, \n\nwhat I need is a single app which will not ask me to manage apps instead
  of it managing my life \n\nany recommendation would be appreciated <3"
