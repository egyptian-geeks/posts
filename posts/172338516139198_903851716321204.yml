    message: ':D :D :D I love your conformance to standards, but the idea here is
      that the most important algorithms are implemented. I don''t know what you mean
      by "int main" was standardized 26 years ago, but back in 1992 when I was coding
      on Turbo C ++ it was void main, and it stayed like that in the early 2000s as
      well. I understand the idea about standards, but believe me, there are Biarne
      books with void main :)'

    message: I remeber cause I had the C++ handbook amd there was even an older book
      about just Plain C, which is why here you have printf and scanf. Because this
      is an app that shows code to implement algorithms, I guess the main thing here
      is the naming conventions.  And if you're smart enough to be able to code all
      the algorithms, we can forgive you for using void main :)

    message: this was code from Bjarne's book, but amazingly I have been using void
      main since I started to program in the 90s. Not that I coded C++ for 20 years,
      but even in Uni there was no fuss. Anyway, the point is, the algorithm implementation
      is too much of a benefit to miss over this small mistake if we can call it that

    message: Ahmad Fatoum great information, and yes it was Turbo C++ for Dos 3.0
      then 3.2 then 3.22. So tell me, What IDE do you use over Linux ? and do you
      have a "good" reference imlementation that is this comprehensive? I personally
      would convert all the samples into Python and send it to the develper if and
      when I have the time, cause I mainly like Python. I still have this nostalgic
      soft spot for C and C++. Also, with your permission I can send these comments
      to the Author :) now you made me feel like this is more "bershamat qabl imti7an"
      at uni :)
