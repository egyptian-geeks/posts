    message: i think that ur programming language is irrelevant here. you need to
      search if anyone already did that and you can buy this plugin and integrate
      it with your code. or the you built it with HTML5 if possible or flash.

    message: I know that there are many advanced apps on IPAD that does this in very
      professional way. note that dentists may prefer to use a native app on IPAD
      than a website. so think again what will you provide more than the current apps
      do. and if a website is the best way to do it.
