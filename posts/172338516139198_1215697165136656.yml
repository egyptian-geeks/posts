  SA,
  I'm having a huge problem in my coding life. I'm too attached to Java.
  I DO code other languages (python,ruby,C,C++), but when it comes to my choice, I always choose Java.
  Even when I started learning Server Side, I started with ROR. It's so powerful, but still I wasn't so enthusiastic about it, but once I tried JavaEE I just fell in love with it from the first line of code, thinking of the cool projects I can implement in Java.
  The question is: Is what I'm feeling normal? Is it healthy? If not, why am I feeling this? And how can I overcome this?
  Thanks in advance.

      About coding in general, having Java as a preference is quite common. It gives what you want.

      But I am quite surprised that you like Java EE: It is one of the worst options for web apps in 2016, who wants to write several classes to get the same function as two lines in PHP or nodeJs?

      And why is this a problem?
      Having one fluent language as your preferred language is not a problem, but you have to get over this preference and occasionally use others, because each language has it's own field of use, while you can create mostly anything with Java, you will not create any usable web app without enough JS and AJAX these days, also doing a chat or real-time server in JEE is not the best choice without some reactive framework and/or lot's of  nonblocking IO operations.

    message: My advice, follow what you love. Java is a great language and it is the
      most desirable language to know worldwide. Aside from that, it is fully OO with
      functional features and can run on all platforms. It is syntactically similar
      to C,C++ and C# and ECMASCRIPT, so I say coding in Java will only make you a
      better programmer. In addition to that, the Java frameworks are amazing, and
      you can learn a lot about architecture and design from them, just keep your
      ability to also wrote Python,Ruby, so you break your fear of switching to other
      styles of programming.

    message: I usually do questions on hacker rank/ topcoder to get comfy with a new

      questions like what data structures it has, what's passed by reference or value,
      and how does it handle strings
