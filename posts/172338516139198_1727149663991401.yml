  Geeks,

  Does anyone use Jenkins(or any hosted or non hosted CI servers) in solo projects?

  I mean do you invest time in devops in solo projects?

  Can everyone share with me your experience , like why and wthat you use an when do you use or when do you decide investing time in devops when it comes to solo projects ( specially if its a freelance gig) ?

  Thank you all

      I usually use gitlab as it has its own CI. You can try its task runners using docker images and it has an auto scaling feature in order not to use standalone servers for your deployments. And above all it’s for free..

      It’s always a good practice to automate your deployments even in solo projects as it saves a lot of time and effort during your cycle for different builds.

    message: and another question for Amr Abdelwahab Mohamed Hamza , you'd also setup
      you CI even if you won't work on the project afterward? you'd just handle the
      project to the client and you are working solo on the project , may i ask your
      opinion in this scenario what would you chose to do ?
