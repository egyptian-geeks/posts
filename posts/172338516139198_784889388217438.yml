message: I was told yrs ago partitioning disks can have slight performance benefit.
  This is not the case w/ Virtual / Hyper-V disks, right? Nor SSDs?

      By far SSDs are the fastest of course, they have no mechanical structure, as
      a pure analog control circuits, but SSDs are pure digital, and their SATA interface
      speed SATA, > 1.5 Gbit/s.

    message: It used to be said that sort of physical load distribution happens when
      you run things on multiple partitions, that is less than multiple physical disks,
      and is more than a single partition. I was wondering whether the same wisdom
      applies to SSDs, and whether it applies to virtual disks as well (Hyper-V in
      particular, if it makes a difference).

    message: I don't know why would partitioning disks can increase the performance
      ? maybe someone elaborate the technical idea behind that.

    message: Partitioning has little real world significance in terms of performance...
      if you want that you should look for RAID configs or SSDs or the 10krpm HDDS

    message: To be more specific, I have a Hyper-V VM (VPS), with SSD disk, I was
      wondering whether I'd gain any performance by partitioning it, or not worth
      it (with backup / disaster recovery aside for this question).

    message: Short answer, no! but you can try it out and run some benchmarks.. the
      difference will mainly be synthetic.

    message: I don't think so, SSDs their own structure (memory mapped), lets you
      to read the data very fast regardless of the partitions. basically consider
      your SSD is just a normal Flash Memory.

    message: I'm kind of leaning towards "No" as well. For being a virtual disk more
      than for being SSD, but needed validation from someone else, not to just depend
      on guessing.
