  - description: "Happy Ada Lovelace Day -- an international celebration of women
      in science and technology! English mathematician Ada Lovelace is widely considered
      the world's first computer programmer for her invention of the computer algorithm.
      Born in 1815 to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Byron, Lovelace's mathematical
      talents led to an ongoing collaboration with mathematician Charles Babbage,
      who called Lovelace the \"Enchantress of Numbers.\" While translating an article
      by an Italian engineer on Babbage's Analytical Engine, a proposed early version
      of a mechanical general-purpose computer, Ada added her own set of notes which
      contained a tremendous breakthrough -- the first computer program or algorithm.\n\nAda
      Lovelace Day was started in Britain in 2009 as a day for creating new role models
      for girls and women in technical fields by raising the profile of today’s female
      STEM leaders. The event's founder, Suw Charman-Anderson, described the significance
      of this special day as follows: \"Ada Lovelace Day is not only about raising
      Ada’s profile, but also shining a spotlight on the achievements of all women
      in STEM, both historic and modern. It’s about drawing inspiration from all women,
      not just the famous ones, and supporting women at every stage of their career,
      from the choice of what to study at school and university through too often
      challenging professional milestones.\" \n\nIn honor of Ada Lovelace Day, please
      tell us about a historical or modern day woman in STEM who inspires you -- and,
      if it's someone you know personally, you can also tag her in the comments below.
      To learn more about Ada Lovelace Day, visit their website at http://findingada.com/\n\nIf
      you'd like to introduce your children to Ada Lovelace's incredible story, there's
      a brand new picture book biography, \"Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine,\"
      for ages 5 to 9 at http://www.amightygirl.com/ada-lovelace-thinking-machine\n\nThis
      trailblazer is one of the 52 female scientists profiled in the recently released
      “Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science – and The World,\" which is highly
      recommended for teens and adults alike at http://www.amightygirl.com/headstrong-52-women
      \n\n11-year-old Ada Lovelace is also the star of the fictionalized mystery novel
      for ages 8 to 12, “The Case of the Missing Moonstone,” at http://www.amightygirl.com/the-case-of-the-missing-moonstone\n\nFor
      adult readers who would like to learn more about Ada Lovelace and her contributions
      to computing, check out \"Ada's Algorithm: How Lord Byron's Daughter Ada Lovelace
      Launched the Digital Age\" at http://amzn.to/1R9d6Up\n\nIf you'd like to inspire
      your Mighty Girl's interest in science, you can introduce her to many stories
      of girls and women in science -- both in fiction and real-life -- with the titles
      featured in our \"Science & Technology\" book section at http://www.amightygirl.com/books/general-interest/science-technology
      \n\nAnd, for more fun ways to encourage your Mighty Girl's interest in technology
      and computer programming, check out our blog post, \"Inspiring Invention: 25
