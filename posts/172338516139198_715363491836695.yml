      Live Calculator + Math module using ruby and sinatra

      this calculator will open port 3000 using sinatra and listen on two
      paths the root (http://localhost:3000/) to load the calculator HTML
      and /calc path (http://localhost:3000/calc) to evaluate expression

      when you write any expression such as (2+2) javascrip will send the
      expression as you type to /calc path and get teh result into a div with
      id=result

      i included the Math module so you can use cos, sin, tan and any method
      within the ruby Math Module.

      also as this calculator uses eval method you can use it to evaluate a
      pure ruby expression such as "Emad "*10 this will print "Emad" 10 times

      have fun and let me know how did you use it ;)
