      FILE* and fopen, fwrite, fclose .. etc are an example of OOP in C.
      FILE is a forward declared but undefined struct. You only have a pointer to it (Encapsulation)
      fopen and fclose, construct/destruct it.
      All functions take a FILE* which acts like the this pointer.
      The standard guarantees no padding at start of a struct, so you can make a SPECIAL_FILE with  FILE as first member and cast between them, given you know the composition of it (Inheritance).

      If you want to go overboard, you can hack some preprocessor code for new/delete and make class-like things using structs of function pointers.

      For private static members you can use different translation units (files) and declare them static.

      That's what I could think of. There is a free ebook (http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf) which I didn't have time to read yet. It surely has a lot more ideas on how to do this.

      Also remember the very first C++ compiler was just a preprocessor for C. You can go a long way without explicit OO support.
      I even once saw a OO implementation in BATCH (yes, windows batch), but can't find it at the moment.

    message: Another language I had limited exposure to is Lua. It uses key/value
      pairs to add functions and variables to an object, thereby emulating classes
      and allows you to register custom handlers with the VM to handle operators.
      Might be worth looking into.

      mm, ignore my first example. I didn't see the object-oriented languages part..
      For languages designed with OO in mind but with no classes look here:
