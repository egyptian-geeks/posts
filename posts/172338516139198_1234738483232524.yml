      "Don't be clever. Don't try to write complicated code on purpose to show how smart you are. Write simple, clear, reusable code. Think Simplicity, Clarity, Generality."

      I think this should be plastered on the computer of every new programmer on any team. Or on their face. And particularly for new C programmers, something should auto-punch them every time they use a pointer unnecessarily. In C++ it should threaten their life.

      Needed to vent. Thanks for understanding.

    message: you learn the best way to solve a problem , it's not about the language
      you are using , it's about how to used the language to write efficient code
      that gives the best results in fastest way , also learn different software applications
      , components , life cycle of the software engineering and different methodologies
      to deliver the output to the customer and by mentioning customer , I'd say last
      is to learn and have experience of how the customer think so you are able to
      apply customer requirements the way they want not the way u think they do

    message: Learn OO properly, see past the syntax, think in terms of abstractions,
      learn to make any problem you face a computer science problem and the answers
      will become apparent very quickly.
