message: How do you measure your productivity? and give estimates to projects? I agree
  with this article that measuring developer performance with hours he spent on office
  is so wrong but most of companies do that

    message: I like to pick a task that the team estimates at 2 weeks from 2 people
      for example. Figure out what the problem is and show them how it can be done
      in 2 days. Usually, for this to work, it is a task that can be solved by implementing
      the right design pattern(s) with a properly placed abstract class / Interface
      for default behaviour and generics. I use this example to show how productivity
      should be measured by output not hours.
