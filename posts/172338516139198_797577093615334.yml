    message: I'm afraid facebook is a bubble, any decent investor would check the
      P/E ratio! Facebook is only for speculators, with no clear cashflow in the near
      future this bubble will eventually burst!

      lacks vision

    message: IBM and Facebook have nothing in common in terms of services nor products,
      it is hard and even unrealistic to make a comparison between them, we might
      as well compare IBM to McDonalds while we're at it.

    message: I don't think also FB Revenue comes any near to IBM if you even try to
      compare the Revenue of the 2 companies. IBM is the Elephant!

    message: Strongly agreed with Amr Eldib, IBM is a computing behemoth, invented
      so many things that became now standard for daily life computing and communication.
      Its patents portfolio ONLY makes revenue more than top software companies like
      Oracle, NetApp & Others
