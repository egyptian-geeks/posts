    message: AngularJS it's one more "hipster" library. only used until another one
      comes up. Usually a new one rises because the old one wasn't "enough" for production.

    message: In theory what comes next is not a library, but a standard. The Web Components
      standard. I find Angular.JS very functional though, if you are building most
      of the UI yourself especially.

    message: I find it hard to recommend it now knowing its going through very big
      refactoring now that will show maybe by the time of 1.2 (maybe end of this year?
      not sure). For the same reason I expect it'll cover the main current problems,
      but it also means a lot of the APIs will feel obsolete shortly.

    message: Knockout is easier for people who don't have a lot of experience in JS,
      while Angular covers more areas. The whole area of SPAs is new & we will witness
      a lot :)

    message: from supporting multi culture teams including tens of developers for
      over a year at a previous client, I can tell you from first hand experience
      that Knockout in real world large applicants can be very problematic for those
      starters who are not comfortable with JS. In Angular. js though the only thing
      that new people seem to keep hitting is understanding inheritance in child scopes,
      which is becoming very common that there are very good resources about it now
      already

    message: 'Both Knockout and AngularJS will disappear in a couple of Month as the
      trend is going way farther to the use of Web components and less playing with
      the DOM :) introducing the new Shadow DOM. Mozilla Already released their Web
