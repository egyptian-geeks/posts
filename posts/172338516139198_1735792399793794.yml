  Tech Talk: What's trending for 2018?
  The end of passwords may – or may not – be nigh. Blockchain is clearly evolving, as is 'serverless' computing. And our panel remains convinced Apple's HomePod is late to the game.

  * At the 10:31 mark, Mingis details how far blockchain has moved beyond its cryptocurrency roots
  * At the 20:30 mark, Syegulalp explains what "serverless computing" is (and isn't) and why it's important
  * And then finally at the 28:01 mark, Simon weighs in on why he's planning to get one of Apple's new HomePods (it arrives Feb. 9), even though it's high-priced and (for now, at least) seemingly under-featured.
