  SA,
  Do you normally store users' file uploads on the filesystem of your server, or you use an external file hosting service?

    message: You can buy blob storage space separately on AWS S3 or Azure, it is much
      more scalable, and makes your server stateless, so you don't need to worry about
      hardware failure or losing customer's data

    message: I would typically just store my uploads on the filesystem. Unless you
      happen to experience heavy traffic and/or serve critical content (where high
      availability is a must), then I would consider CDNs.

    message: "Usually the scalability category of the application and the hosting
      category tell you what to do.\n\nIf you are hosting in the cloud, you host your
      user files in a cloud file hosting service, called BLOB storage usually. No
      other option. \n\nIf you host your application on multiple servers, even if
      not in the cloud, you host them somewhere else, because again, no option. Might
      be cloud or same data centre file server or even DB (kinda outdated option,
      and DBs aren't really optimised for it).\n\nIf you are hosting on one server
      because your app is that small, you can just host the files on the same server
      for ease. Hopefully you get periodic backups of the folder though, ideally automated."
