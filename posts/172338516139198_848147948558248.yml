message: "ASP.NET Community Standup - Nov 18th, 2014 - Open Source All The Things\nhow
  to make it ? \nthey said good point related to mono and xamarin \nmono run on ios
  application and android ( not mac or linux only )\nbut their version of dot net
  not compatible 100% ( they used reflector in some parts) as Microsoft code was not
  open source in all\nso Microsoft ask them to build anew mono version based on .net
  version 5 so there's would no be a compatibility issues \nmono on their blog announced
  similar thing too \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0Y0zMOrxk&feature=youtu.be&a"
