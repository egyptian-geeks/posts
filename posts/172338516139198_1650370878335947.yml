    message: I read a beautiful quote taken from Michael Sipser's theory of computation
      book "... theory is good for you because studying it expands your mind... Specific
      technical knowledge, though useful today, becomes outdated in just a few years.
      Consider instead the abilities to think, to express yourself clearly and precisely,
      to solve problems, and to know when you haven’t solved a problem. These abilities
      have lasting value. Studying theory trains you in these areas."

      I'm one of the type 2 engineers.

      Frankly, I don't see myself gravitating towards studying computer science at all, and not for the lack of trying.

      I know it'd make me a better developer, but it just isn't worth it for me.

      I write code to build products that people will find useful, this is what's fulfilling to me.

      For example, I don't find machine learning or all of the data science domain interesting at all, and this seems to be the branch of computer science that's gaining traction these days.

      I'm perfectly comfortable learning new tools because let's face it, there's nothing more fun than learning a cool new tool. (Yeah, maybe making your code faster is fun too, but not to me).

      In the end, it's all about what makes you happy, don't fall for anyone who tries to convince you that you're doing it wrong and that you should be doing X instead of Y to be part of the exclusive group of programmers who are doing The Right Thing™
