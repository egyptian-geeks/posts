  Gandi, my DNS hoster is having an event where they give out stuff for free because of their 15th anniversary:
  https://15.gandi.net/

  I got a free *.xyz domain for a year,
  Maybe someone can put it to good use:
  G15XYZ-378F-57B4-B71D

  I thought about buying root-a.xyz but then said maybe someone has a better use.
