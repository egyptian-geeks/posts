message: "How do you go about learning new technologies? When I first started around
  20 years ago before the internet we had to rely on books so my first instinct is
  read the official documentation/reference (that's what the big books we kept in
  libraries are called kids... Also books are chunks of papers glued together), but
  recently I tried to learn something new using a udemy course and it made me wonder
  how do kids teach themselves these days? Do you automatically go for these kinds
  of courses? Get your hands dirty and build something to learn along the way? Go
  for the official documentation first like an adult?\n\n(Old folks over 30 don't
  count here, you're not young anymore \U0001F603)"

      When I was first learning elasticsearch, I used the official documentation because everything else was wrong or outdated.

      That was also the case when I was learning Go, the official documentation was also so great that I didn't even feel the need for additional help.

      With that being said, I found two Udacity courses to be particularly indispensable (CS101, CS253) for anyone starting with web development, so those were really useful when I had little to no knowledge about the subject.

    message: "TLDR => Official Docs and Fine Books.\n\"Spend a while on a single thing/technology
      + read the official Docs follow loud speakers of this thing/tech on twitter
      and keep up with what's hot in the community nowadays + build (AT LEAST) one
      project with it + move up from this step with the acquired knowledge and broaden
      your perspective\"\n\n---\nwhen I started out on my journey, I started with
      course on udemy that goes around \"The Complete Web Developer course: (Build
      something like 10 websites as you learn)\" ... the catchy names actually got
      me :D .. but when I met with my \"professional developer\" friends and hear
      them talk and argue about real life problems at work, I felt like I am never
      gonna get anywhere with these types of courses ... then I found Free Code Camp
      and their motto was: (Learn to program while building projects for non-profits)
      and this one really was a huge step for me .. for me, I loved the combination
      of learning step by step and building simple stuff as I go and the complexity
      increases as I go .. they use an All-Javascript-Stack Node.js/ExpressJS/MongoDB/ReactJS
      .. (I also learned A LOT from their medium publication: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/)
      ... after a while I got to a point where I felt that I need deeper understanding,
      for example I need to learn how a server works? what is going on under the hood
      of ExpressJS and other similar web frameworks for other stacks and so on.. \nAnd
      this is the point where I am right now, still chasing more knowledge in the
      feild .. that's meant to go on for ever right? :D"

      I look for a tutorial or a get started guide what was made by the people who made the tech I'm learning, if I there is none I try to find them somewhere else (never had to do that so far, I think). I follow along with the tutorial/guide, and if I feel like I don't understand what's going on, I try changing things and see how the output is affected, if I still don't get it then I head to the documentation of that specific part.
      After I'm done with the basics, I start building things and when I hit the edge of my knowledge I read the docs of that specific part, and sometimes when I'm not even working a question/challenge pops in my head and I go and search docs or stackoverflow. I keep doing that over and over until I move to the next tech.
