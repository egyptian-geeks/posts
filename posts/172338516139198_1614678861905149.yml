  Hi everyone,

  I interviewed at IBM and I got a call from the interviewer and not the HR that I will receive an offer. That was 2 months ago.
  The division I will be working for is a newly established one and he mentioned that they will contact me as soon as they land the first project.

  Based on your experience, should I wait more time for the offer? Should I move on searching for another opportunity?

      Send them an email with emphasis on your excitement about the opportunity and ask them about the status of your offer and the nature of the job, is it part-time, full-time or project based?

      Then based on their answer decide what you wanna do!

      As I worked in IBM for 4 years this is quite normal they take a lot of time in paper work and it’s a full time job but they can’t give you an offer without project.

      No worries also I think is good step in your career path but don’t expect to learn a new things as start-up companies

      If you don't have an offer of employment with a start date then you don't have anything yet.

      Don't put your life on hold waiting, keep searching and if you get a good opportunity take it, you can always leave if the other comes along. Any company that tells you to wait that long can take a month, a year, or more, or they may never contact you, so don't hold your breath, they are under no obligation to you yet. Go on searching normally until you have an actual offer in your hand.

      Also, I found that the work atmosphere in a small to mid size company better than large multinational ones anyways, they are usually more laid back and you are appreciated more, in a multinational you end up being a gear in a large corporate machine and the only thing you do gain is a name on your resume.
