    message: It really depends on your definition of "better". Bootstrap is definitely
      faster to set up and it gives you so many things ready-made, but this can be
      a pain if you want to customize everything. Foundation gives you just enough
      to get you going. But then again they have a lot in common so it comes down
      to personal preference I think. There are plenty of opinion-based articles about
      that.

      - Foundation is lighter thus better for light websites (not really heavy stuctured with lots of pages website).
      - Bootstrap is too much for simple websites but it's better (better in terms of being easier and faster) than foundation.
      or that's what I think

      Use bootsteap if you want to build something quickly and you are not bound by a specific mockup.
      Use foundation if you have a specific design you want to implement it.
      Foundation can be customized ALOT rather than bootstrap that has the same look and feel even with different themes.
      The only drawback in foundation is that it does not have that many plugins as much as bootstrap.

      From my experience ...
      If you are looking for a *framework* to build *responsive* latyouts *only* then use Foundation or any other responsive grid system ... Even better if the layout isn't that complicated, man up and build your own responsive grid system :) For hundreds of reason if you ask why ...
      Use Bootstrap ONLY if the project you are building is huge and you need a lot of UI modules ... Think like a dashboard.
