message: "Dear Geeks, \nThis is not a job post. I am looking for a recruitment advise.
  I have been looking for a good technical team that has experience in the open source
  stack and knowledge in a heterogeneous, high availability project but I still can't
  find them. I have budget, I want four team members in a different levels. I can't
  find a complete team that integrates well together and will get me the expected
  results. \nDid anyone face the same problem before? Shall I switch technology and
  start depends on the .NET stack? Shall I hire people from East Europe? I didn't
  start yet but I can see the risk. \nYour thoughts are highly appreciated"

    message: most of developers working with enterprise tools even open source or
      .Net , if you looking for technology that need to fit with your business i recommend
      to look for developers have skills in JS frameworks like Angularjs , nodejs
      and good experience working with web API , i think it will be better than any
      PHP framework or .Net, in this case you free to handle any business you needed
      with high performance.

    message: My advice, don't look for open source stack developers from Egypt...
      Very few good ones remain and will probably not give you the results you want,
      plus they'll cost you higher (although you said you do have the budget for them
      but it's worth mentioning)... Either outsource to East Europe, India etc...
      if you're stuck to a certain technology, or work with local talents using what
      they know well (.NET stack, Java, etc...)... And one more note, comparing technologies
      to each other is like comparing apples to oranges... You can achieve anything
      you want, with any new or old tech that is available in the market, if you have
      the right team who understands it well and who are able to work with you towards
      the goals you define.

      Most probably I missed something about your post, but was wondering how you realized you would need 4 engineers before selecting the technology stack?

      Just sharing some thoughts:
      1. I think technology selection is a first step before hiring the entire team. You are talking about an enterprise level project, so if there is some kind of enterprise architecture/architects, this should help in the decision.
      2. I'd start with most senior staff - usually an application architect. This individual is usually professional enough to work remotely. So the earth is open for you. Would give preference to Egypt for expansion purpose and supervising less seniors staff later.
      3. Ensure legality when hiring from other countries and how law is respected there. Ensure appropriate DNA is in place. A good pool of talents at competitive prices is available at www.upwork.com I worked some projects on elance, their previous brand, and I can say they have some of the best calibers. You can recruit part time, terminate contract anytime, all flexibility you could need.
      4. Once things are clear, you can start hiring less senior engineers from Egypt under the supervision of the architect.
      5. If applicable in your case, go agile.... meaning let your architect do a first POC, no need for a team at this stage to test things out.

      I also think hiring top fresh grads is most promising for long term business lines, however for single projects hiring seniors is probably better.
      Fresh grads require some training, could be a few months, and usually move faster for better packages.
