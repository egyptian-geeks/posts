  How do people from community/work in your region pronounce git or other common tools?
  I know it is pronounced like get from a video of linus trovalds
  But i just had many awkward conversations when i don't understand them .
  -Do you use JEEET or HEG ?
  -me : What are these ?
  -JEET like JEEThub and JEETlab.

  Edit : for a reason or another this post is offensive , I really have no idea why.
  So I am sorry if you find it so. I am not making fun of someone I just need to know​ how it is common to refer to "tools" verbally.

    message: It is git, with a hard g, as in good. Because it gets its name from the
      English word git. This is not a case like gif where the name is new and debatable
