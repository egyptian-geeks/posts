  Hi guys,
      As a side project I intend to download source codes from sites like github, bitbucket, codeplex, code.google, codeproject even code snippets from SOF, msdn and any well-known blog (Yes, I am intend to load a very big amount of codes) and then I will try to index them and try to learn something from them, and my question is
     What a machine can learn from parsing billions of code blocks, I already have some ideas but I need more
   Thank you

      - Best practice of the same idea ;)
      - Creating a simple/complex app or something in between :D
      - The layers or levels of projects( which code/update have to come first ) ;)
      - Learn the difference between syntax of many languages and the ability of generating a code for a certain language ;)

      - Detect similar code & abstract it in methods/classes/libraries
      - See how many people copied code from SOF
      - Find the funniest code comment
      - Find the people who wrote the core engine of IE, find their home address, kidnap them & apply on them every technique in SAW movile
