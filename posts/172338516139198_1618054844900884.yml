    message: "okay here is my crack for this question, I have struggled too for sometime
      to find a good start regarding algorithm and how to study them in a good way,
      but  basically it divides into two main categories, first Time complexity, which
      is the ability to understand the performance of your code, and how long will
      it run to finish the job, this is essential for you so that you can understand
      what is the bottle neck and think for ideas to overcome the limitations, now
      a good list of youtube tutorials about time complexity can be found in the following
      link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8syQKTdgdzc\n\nand you can practice the
      basics with this site\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/dashboard/\n\nsecond point
      is data structures, which is very important for you to learn and now about arrays,
      linked lists, tree, maps, hashing etc, and know the pros and cons for each one.\na
      very good book that has java examples for building all kinds of data structures,
      and graph explaining how the data get stored and manipulated can be found here
      \nhttp://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/"

    message: "now after you learn the basics of those two main points, here comes
      the algorithms parts, first you need to understand the algorithms techniques,
      like divide and conquer, brute force, dynamic programming, backtracking, and
      you can find their explanation in wikipedia, then study the famous algorthims
      like ( sorting , tree navidation, etc) now after you have learned about all
      of that there is a good book called Think like a programmer, which give you
      a simples steps with examples on how to try to solve a problem in a creative
      way \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246"

      so you reached that stage you have learned all the tools studied some algorithms and learn how to crack a problem, now comes the practice part there is many sites the offer code practice, put the top four on my list that I like to train with are the following,
      https://www.firecode.io
      https://www.hackerrank.com
      https://codility.com
      https://www.codingame.com/home

      they all offer a vast range of problems especially HackerRank, from Easy problems to Hard ones, so check them out and pick the one you are most comfortable with and start trainning.

      now my last advice, is that don't be so stubborn when solving a problem, don't spent days thinking about a single problem when you can find the answer over the Internet, it's okay to fail and don't know about the solution that why you train and it's okay to see other people code and see different solution approaches so that you can use it into your arsenal, my personal preference, is that for easy problems give yourself max 30 min to solve, and for medium ones an hour, and for hard ones max 2 hours, when you reach the limit check the answer and learn and try to find a similar problem and solve it.
      which you the best of luck :)
