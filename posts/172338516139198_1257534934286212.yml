      milliseconds average SERVER response time\nAfter months of work, we just unlocked
      the 8 milliseconds milestone :D\n--\nFor people want more details, we passed
      through these milestones inside an ASP.NET MVC website:\n.\n1- Database optimization,
      we used sp_whoisactive stored procedure and other tools to identity and fix
      slow sql queries\n.\n2- We started to use Dapper side-by-side with Entity Framework
      to help us have more control on queries we need to optimize manually \n.\n3-
      We built our own custom in-memory caching engine, at the heart it is powered
      by ConcurrentDictionary \n.\n4- We refactored the model layer to minimize the
      need for sql joins and lazy loading, inspired by document-oriented model from
      \ NoSql world\n.\n5- We moved the sync operations between our in-memory caching
      engine and the database to the background, thanks to Hangfire \n.\n6- We shoot
      down any RenderAction as we can, we prepare view model once, and use RenderPartial
      as much as we can \n.\n7- We used MiniProfiler all the way to measure server
      response time :D"
