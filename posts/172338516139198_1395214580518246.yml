      It really depends on what to develop , learning native ios is very troublesome , you need a mac , a license from apple ($100 yearly) and a lot of papers.
      Android is relatively easier , all your problems will be being angry at java and cursing android studio all day and night.
      Going cross platform is better by every mean , no need for mac, no slow ide , no license to just learn and deploy
      Try something like ionic for simple apps, and apache cordova for games (not so performant some times) ,and not so simple apps

    message: Mobile crossplatform is more of a niche market, and personally I do not
      see that changing anytime soon. If you are still starting out and are interested
      in mobile development I highly recommend learning both platforms. The order
      by which you do that is totally up to you, based on what languages you currently
      know and what hardware you have.

      you should focus in one thing and gain the most knowledge you can in it.

      I work with both Android &iOS but you will have to build your skills horizontally between both of them and it won't be easy to keep up with the rapid changes with both platforms but it's doable

      But as you go in your career you will find yourself getting more knowledge and experience in one of them more than the other (Android in my case) but you will still be a good developer in the other platform.
      .
      In brief i would describe it as follow
      I'm experienced in Android yet i did some really good apps in iOS too
