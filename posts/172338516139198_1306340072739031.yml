  what is the size of background images and graphics should i ask from the designer ?!
  in other words yes i use responsive design but my thought is for example i have slides which requires to be wide and it will be used again for a 4 column div for example ! should i ask for multiable versions ? and what if someone is viewing from a big screen such as IMac , in general about image sizes i'm confused as hell.
