      Create folders by feature, not by file type.

      This is the best all advices, and should be applied for other frameworks as well. This talk was about the same advice as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884

      That's why I put the disclaimer in there. The question is about using Angular and about large projects. It's not about whether to use Angular, or how to use it from beginning.

    message: It is less relevant for other tools mainly because of the state of the

      should be the default choice.

      are the same, some of them come from the time angular was new and everyone was
      just worried about reverting to jQuery. Now, these are what I learned: - Use
