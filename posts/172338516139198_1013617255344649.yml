    message: There are no cases where it can be legal. Compare it to someone deciding
      you cannot enter your house. Would you like that?

    message: "Sherif Omar  houses are private  , websites are public and in case of
      government website it is considered a public service which in some laws it is
      allowed to protest against \n\ncheck out the statement from the link below \n\n\"There
      is a legal precedent for such comparisons. In May 2006, a court in Germany,
      was asked if a DDoS blockade of Lufthansa for allowing its planes to be used
      in the deportation of asylum-seekers was in fact a demonstration. The Frankfurt
      appeals court ruled that the 2001 DDoS attack against Lufthansa that was also
      accompanied by a sit-in at the company’s headquarters, did not violate German
      law.\"\n\nhttp://www.hackersunited.com/tag/lufthansa/"

    message: Using DDoS as a form of protest has been going for a few years, it was
      used by AnonOps during the "arab spring" ... and there were various attempts
      by OpEgypt during Jan 25, none of them were that effective though as far as
      I've seen.
