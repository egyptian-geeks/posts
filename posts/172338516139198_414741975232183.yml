  CLIENT: Yeah, we’re not paying for this.

  ME: Why not? I’ve spent three weeks on this.

  CLIENT: Because we can just use the sample you sent us. Think ahead next time.

  CLIENT: Ah. Crap. We need you to send us the final version then.

  ME: After I receive payment, sure.

  CLIENT: Is that really necessary?
