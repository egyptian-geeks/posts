  For android/ios developers,
  Is there is any way to create an application that can generate  applications eg .APk
   with different ids, signature
  I mean that something like Dreamweaver

      There is already many apps on play store.
      I am not sure about iOS but I it will need jailbreak to install a non signed app , you can sign an app ofc,but you shouldn't make users use your certificate

      You can either make compilation localy or use a cloud service.

      What are you planning to do ?
