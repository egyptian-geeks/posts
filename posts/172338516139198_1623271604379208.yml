  - description: "Java 9 has been finally released. \U0001F60E\nThe programming enthusiasts
      would be pretty relieved as Java 9 Standard Edition was previously delayed due
      to modularity controversy. Find Java SE Development Kit 9 Downloads here : \nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\nJDK
      9 is the first major upgrade to standard Java edition since March 2014. It comes
      loaded with tons of new features, which makes it a pretty exciting release for
      developers.\n\nJava 9 features: Brief overview\nProject Jigsaw — Module System\n\nThe
      major change in Java 9 comes in the form of Project Jigsaw, which is an all-new
      module system. It’s the most important feature of Java, that has also received
      tons of criticism. This feature will bring modularity to JDK, run-time images,
      Java source code, etc. The developers can also create their own modules and
      simplify the code.\n\nLearn more about flagship Java 9 features with these useful
      Java 9 courses here on Udemy.\nhttps://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=java%209&src=ukw&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-JbYHhJaY6aP9EWHwLUcJjg&LSNPUBID=TnL5HPStwNw\n\n-
      JShell\nWith JDK 9, now you can fire the JShell from the console and go crazy
      with your Java code. JShell allows you to test different Java constructs without
      any hassle.\n\n- Stream API enhancements\nWith Stream API enhancements, Java
      9 comes with the added methods to conditionally take or drop items from the
      Stream, create a Stream from nullable value while expanding Java SE APIs, etc.\n\n-
      Process API Changes\nWith Process API improvements, Java 9 ensures that OS process
      are controlled and managed in a better manner.\n\n- Segmented Code Cache\nWith
      the help of Segmented Code Cache in JDK 9, the code cache can be divided into
      different segments. Each of those segments can contain compiled code of a particular
      type. This Java 9 feature is expected to improve performance.\n\n- Ahead of
      time compilation\nWhile it’s in the experimental stage, AOT-compilation is expected
      to improve the startup time of applications.\n\n- New HTTP 2 Client\nJava 9
      features list is incomplete without the mention of a new HTTP client API for
      implementing HTTP/2 and WebSocket. It’ll improve web page loading times, performance,
      and reduce resource usage.\n\n- Parser API for Nashorn\nJDK 9 ships with a parser
      API for Nashorn, whose goal was to implement a lightweight high-performance
      JS runtime in Java with a native JVM. This API ensures better Project Nashorn
      JS support\n\n- Other major-minor features\nThe other Java 9 features are:\n\n-
      Multi-release JARs\n- Process API updates\n- Garbage Collector improvements\n-
      Better Javadoc\n- Private interface methods\nThat’s not all :D \n The list of
      Java 9 features is even longer. You can find the complete set of features in
      the release notes. ;)\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/9u-relnotes-3704429.html\n\nDownload
      Java 9\nAs Java 9 Standard Edition is now publicly available, go ahead and download
      it from here ;)\nhttps://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=java%209&src=ukw&siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-bXvfbitOf1Zze9RfDI57Hw&LSNPUBID=TnL5HPStwNw\n\n.
      Don’t forget to share your views on JDK 9 and personal experiences with us.
