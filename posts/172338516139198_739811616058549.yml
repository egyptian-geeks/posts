    message: "Has little to do with being a geek or not. XP is not a heaven for an
      average joe, windows as a platform is generally considered user friendly albeit
      that's debatable but it has nothing to do with XP being easier to use.\nIt's
      a policy and a culture commonly attributed to the notion of \"if it works, don't
      break it\". Last thing a government wants is \n\na) Requesting a budget for
      a technology infrastructure reinvestment, which involves a senate hearing and
      a financial committee that must approve this for the next fiscal year. \n\nAny
      government contract that included XP saw this coming, Microsoft didn't just
      pull the plug like that. Everyone was aware of the date and time XP would be
      retiring.\n\nb) Migrating to a new infrastructure usually means tripling your
      costs, they already have an array of services, databases, terminal clients and
      softwares known to operate well enough on XP and have been for the past decade
      or so.\n\nIt also means new contracts, so if the UK companies house bought a
      database administration tool from a vendor that has it within their contract
      to offer support for their tool on XP. This calls for a new contract, governments
      dislike new contracts if it means more costs.\n\nc) In a large organization,
      employee efficiency is inversely proportional with infrastructure updates. An
      upgrade almost always means cutting efficiency to half.\n\nLastly, it's just
      how the world works. The big and old don't jumps ship when a new cool technology
      hits the block, if your pockets are deep enough, then you likely have a team
      of risk averse decision makers."

    message: My bet is on the existence of some critical software app that doesn't
      work well with Windows 7 (and most likely IE in particular) and would cost seversl
      magnitudes of this nimber to rewrite (not to mention time to develop,  and risk
      of new bugs etc).

    message: Having looked at the post, seeing the contract gives only one year, I'm
      starting to think maybr the upgrade is actually planned and they just need some
      safe time until it takes place. If this is anything more the contract would
      hsve last much longer
