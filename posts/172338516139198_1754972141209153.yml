    message: I was running Dev since they started that release and was solid, lately
      there has been more and more of very obvious and annoying bugs that stick for
      long weeks, so I switched to Beta starting today.

      Been using Dev built for over the past 4 years. More stable than Canary and you get the new development features in Chrome at least 3 months before the latest release
      Dev channel IMHO is a MUST have for any front-end developer
