      If your work machine belongs to the company, then it's their responsibility. If it belongs to you, then you also have a responsibilty for installing illegal stuff.

      Disclaimer:
      This is not a legal advice. Take it like a guess.

    message: From my point of view, You should talk to them about that and if they
      didn't listen to you should report them unless you don't have the right to publish
      anything about the company including the software they use.
