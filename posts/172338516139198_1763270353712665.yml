    message: "Unity is way easier to learn and get yourself comfortable with game
      development. \nBut unreal should be your next step after Unity, it's much more
      advanced.\n\nFor Unity: there are a lot of online tutorials ( Unity has their
      own tutorials but I don't prefer them). You will need to be familiar with c#
      or JS. But if not, don't worry, they are both easy to learn as long as you know
      OOP. AR is easy with Unity ( check Vuforia). VR u will need a VR device (ex:
      occulus) \n\nUnreal: it works with blueprints( visual programming) and C++.
      Blueprints are easy to learn. Unreal's own video tutorials  are absolutely amazing.
      I never tried AR with unreal."
