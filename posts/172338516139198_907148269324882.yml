    message: you can but an Android phone for less than 300 LE and it would use assisted
      GPS not true GPS. But Asststed should be good enough for your purposes. I expect
      a dedicated GPS would have more battery life, just make sure you are not paying
      too much.

    message: GPS in nature does not need a connection to mobile networks, they get
      signals from satellites and convert it to longitude and latitude. GPS is far
      more accurate than mobile network positioning, but it requires an open sky view
      to receive the signal. If the open sky is not a problem for your application
      then go for it.

    message: I'v heard there is small GPS device for keeping an eye on the cars, it
      is small, and it uses both GPS and mobiles tours positioning, but I think some
      types needs power source, because it has small batteries that gives only about
      30m to 1 hour, anyone have a car should know places to get it from
