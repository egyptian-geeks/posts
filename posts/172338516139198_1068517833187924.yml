      Nice post indeed.
      Hot topic, simple illustration & concise coding examples.
      Keep up the good work.

    message: "Amr AbuMuslim I just fought with me colleagues whether callbacks are
      rendered obsolete by Promises or Not :)\n\nthe only takeaway I have against
      your post is that your saying Promises are for flow control and I think this
      will be a huge misleading point especially for newly developers in javascript.\n\n
      Simple promises are designed for dealing with the issue of the absence of certain
      information at a certain time.\nlike File system access and API calls where
      you don't have instantly the value so you will have to implement it in the promises
      way :) \nFor flow control in javascript, we don't have any blocking mechanism
      (till ES7 async/await which gives a better interface for it) yet we're left
      with callback functions the only way.. and basically, people uses it as sugar
      coated syntax but intrinsically promises are just callback functions with events.\nSo
      I would say that I don't mind using Promises for control flow but I won't agree
      to name the article \"Do you still use callbacks in your JavaScript? You probably
      need to checkout my post about #Promises.\"\n\nA great article, Though :)"

      Well the functions you send to "then" are basically the callbacks, it's just that now nested callbacks have been flattened.
      The next step here is using the async/await pattern suggested for ECMA Script 7, which (from what I understand) is very similar to what has been implemented in C# 5, you don't have to write any inline functions or reference any functions, behind the scenes all the code after an "await" line gets wrapped into a function and give to the "then" part, so yes it's still the same thing, but you don't see it or have to deal with it :)
      (and BTW at least in C# 5 you could still combine promises, then you can await the new combined promise)
