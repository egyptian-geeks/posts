  او يناقشني في حاجه او يعلق علي حاجه او ينصحني بحاجه او tool او كدا \nياريت\n\nعلشان
  medium مقفول وكدا \n\nTwo and half years ago, on my journey to find a customer obsessed
  company that partially follow the Amazon leadership way, I’ve joined Edfa3ly, it’s
  a startup located in middle east give the middle east shoppers access to us/UK/Fr
  exclusive items using local payment gateways, my original arrangement was to help
  in the management of the team with no solid role definition and I was fine with
  this.\nBefore that, I never joined a company that has internal operations, logistics,
  customer supports, warehousing, and returns. I believe that in order to understand
  most of the business cases better you need to involve in the code base and deal
  with the cases within, so I just started as backend PHP developer.\nEverything was
  great for me. The high-level management was very obsessed with customers, their
  needs, problems, constantly shipping new features to reduce customer complaints,
  fix problems, having an adaptive business plan according to market changes and always
  open to hear and learn new business models from others and even competitors. When
  someone makes a mistake, they act in a calm way to recover and how to prevent it
  from happening in the future with no pointing finger. \nI like new tools and cools
  third-party services, but I love to feel and see the value of what I’m doing and
  how it touches the business and customers. That’s why I loved working there.\nNine
  months later, the company was in a scaling up race, my work with other team members
  was paying off and orders were flying everywhere and the CTO was overwhelmed. I
  jumped into the Team Lead position trying to fulfill that position and to be honest,
  it was devastating for me.\n1- The higher management used to ask for simple changes
  and wait for even a month for them. I used to receive too many requests from different
  people, management, marketing, warehouses, domestic delivery, international shipping,
  customer service and of course the complains about “This is not working” and I had
  such little experience in how to manage this, I was only acting according to the
  most pressing person to get them off my back.\n2- Everyone in the team was working
  very hard, always under pressure. For long days no one saw me even smiling for once.
  Everybody knew the stress I was in.\n3- Tracking tasks, deadlines even the overall
  output was a complete mess. We used to use JIRA but we were doing it wrong and ended
  up spending too much time in JIRA so we tried something else. We tried a couple
  of tools such as Trello, Waffle.io, Evernote, and even Excel but nothing worked
  for us, some of them were too simple like Excel sheets and Evernote, others did
  not fit without big backlog and tasks or maybe we did not use it efficiently that
  time.\n4- The codebase was going south: The codebase was built using Symfony2 which
  was outdated. Reviews of PRs were mostly done (If done) based on personal preferences,
  for how should code be structured, not based on general rules that the team agreed
  on. No tests were written to maintain the project integrity. No matter how much
  time we spent on the code reviews, we always find severe bugs, sometimes even from
  customer reporting.\n5- Pure money losses because of bugs. I used to see bugs everywhere
  in almost every single feature we release. During the disaster recovery, I had to
  report how much was the losses and for someone who loves to see the value of his
  work, this was stressing. Although no one ever blamed me for this kind of issues,
  I felt responsible already.\n6- I was always overloaded, having my laptop on my
  back all the time, I sometimes even worked for 20 hours a day and sometimes during
  weekends. I was doing all kind of stuff you can imagine doing some urgent stuff
  after waiting in our queue for 3 months to get them off my back, fix a problem,
  bring up some down service, review some delayed PRs.\nIn that time I was preparing
  for my marriage too and got two weeks off. In the second week, I got a call about
  some big problem that I had to go to the office. For a whole year, my wife could
  not bear to hear the name of anyone from the company and we had lots of fights in
  that time. She had every right to do so, It was a hard time for us.\n7- I was the
  single point of failure of the team that most of the time failed due to the high
  pressure of so many todos, I’m the only one who knows everything, I was the only
  one who can deploy, I was the only one who builds the todo list, collect problems,
  feedbacks, even I was the one who delivers the tasks for the operations make sure
  they are fine and ok. Simply that was the path of the ones before me in that position
  that I followed without thinking.\n8- One of the most important team members left.
  I also wanted to leave to save my marriage, my life and Egypt was not (and still)
  politically and economically unstable, my salary value (GDP speaking) decreased
  dramatically and it continued to decrease and I was very worried about my family
  future.\nI loved Edfa3ly, the Co-founders trusted me and gave me almost full power
  to take the required actions for the good of the company where and when I saw fit.
  All of this was my choice.\nI hate losing. I wanted to fix all of these problems,
  I felt it was my responsibility towards my team and the company to do something,
  maybe it was not my job do everything, but I wanted to do my best to fix everything\nDuring
  this time two things dramatically changed my thinking. one of them was the “The
  goal”, it made me realize that I need to know my real problem first and by a problem,
  I don’t mean the pressure from the people and problems but I need to know why and
  how the root of the happened in the first place.\nThe other one was a friend talked
  to me about roles in each team and this made me realize that we need to define roles
  for the people who will solve the defined problem. That I can not do everything
  alone, not even If was a superhero, I needed a team to help me with defined roles.\nMy
  first and most important priority was the team but I could not hire more people
  at that time, new hiring requires lot of work and time to be effective team member
  so losing the team means the end, I started to do two things: Smile, over-communicate\nI
  started smiling and dealing with them as friends more than team members, making
  individual one to one weekly meetings to listen to them and them weekly sprint meetings.\nI
  was over communicating with the team, giving them the top priority on our to-do
  list always, telling them the problems we were in, step by step, consulting them,
  asking them for help and for ideas\nKnowledge sharing problem: In our weekly meeting
  I started to share all the knowledge I could, explain every task in technical details
  and business details and its impacts no matter how long it took me to explain, how
  this will relate to other parts of the system, assigning one team member to single
  task, and another team (one or two) member will review and test that task, and give
  them access to deploy to production, I was scared at this point but I wanted to
  trust them to depend on them even more\nProgress tracking: We (the team) agreed
  that we need a tool with specific criteria: tracking everything, the to-dos in-progress,
  and done and in the same time to have specific to-do in our week so that next week
  we can evaluate our performance, We could not resist getting back to adorable Jira\nThe
  scattered and divided requirements: I have classified the company pleaseCanYouDoThis
  tasks into three categories, \n1- the higher management requirements\n2- rest of
  the company \n3- Reported issues ad bugs\nSince the first part required lots of
  debating, asking for details (and knowing the rest of the system and business) discussing
  how this will impact the business and various departments of the company, financial,
  operations, customer service, .. I took over some of this part\nand second point,
  We have agreed (the team) to reduce communications with the everyone to just emails
  rather than face to face communications and to have a PO/PM a weekly rotating role
  between all team members with his only task is building the sprint with me before
  the weekly sprint meeting by collecting and understanding the requirements that
  I gave him and the ones he gather from rest of the company and deicing with me which
  has the higher priority and based on what\nAs for the third point, we created a
  daily rotating role called ‘Technical support’ that his only priority was to take
  of reported issues based on his its classification according to the rules we have
  added\nThe technical debt: we started prioritizing parts that need testing and started
  writing behavioral tests as a start and unit tests :)\nStep by step I started to
  limit my role in the company to just recommend, observe, advise, hiring the missing
  roles and more team members, check the overall progress and giving more space and
  more access to other team members and more visibility and in the same times shielding
  them from outside conflicts that may occur.\nFinally, after months we started to
  make promises we can keep, less and less devastating bugs, more and more experience
  to the team technical and business-wise and pushed value to the customers and operations
  in a few months more than we pushed in a whole year.\n8 months later, I started
  to sleep normally sometimes 10 hours a day, go on vacations in places where no mobile
  signal can reach me. being more lazy :), and in the 9th month I’ve left the company
  and moved to Berlin with no regret or fear that things will fall apart and that
  the team will not hate me or the company one day."
