message: "Hello Guys. look, \nearly this year i asked you if i should put my time
  on js/ruby instead of php. \n& by your help i have chosen js & it was the best thing
  i did all year. i can do things now that i didn't even know it can be done. \njs
  really made my life easier. \nevery complicated task i have ever had wes suddenly
  easier & faster to implement: ( nodejs / gulp / yeoman / webpack / react / angular
  / ionic / electron )\n\nbut i need you again now. over the last year i have noticed
  that the (go) community is growing larger & larger. \nshould i focus on getting
  better with nodejs & the rest of js world. \nor i should put my free time on learning
  (go).\n\nwill learning go & mastering it provide me with better jobs than i can
  get with node //& is go needed in the freelancing community yet or it's just for
  big company ???"

      If you're looking for getting things done in less time (and comfortable with the convention over configuration) go for Ruby in rails. For me i did not built a complete project in go so honestly i can't help with it or know the best cases to use go :D
      If you're talking about finding job, all types of developers are required now. The number of talented developers is decreasing. But for sure the highest salaries goes for Rails.

      Do not be a magpie developer (magpies are birds that collect shiny things). You need deepness and experience in a chosen single language.

      If you have a lot of time in your hand, go learn go, a different style programming language is a different thinking style, so, you expand your mind.

      I wouldn't call it a priority though. A minor improvement over just doing Node. I wouldn't focus for several months on Go as a primary thing.
