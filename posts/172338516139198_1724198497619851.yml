message: "Any recommendations for/experience with data persistence and exchange format
  (Thrift, Protobuff and Avro) and if anyone can shed the light of their integration
  with Parquet. \n\nThe use case is similar to a data pipeline and internal APIs communication."

    message: "I think one main design goal for Avro was data persistence, since Thrift
      wasn't necessary Hadoop friendly, Avro is more flexible since Readers can use
      a different schema than Writers, so even if writer schema changed at some point,
      you could still read the older data using the older reader schema, \nSo in the
      context of data persistence on Hadoop for example, if you ar dumping a lot of
      data at one point, you can also include the writer's schema with it, so next
      time you are trying to read you can load up the schema as a reader schema and
      work off of it, and I think Avro supports this on Hadoop with a specific file
      format (object container files)\nAs for Parquet integration I'm sorry I don't
      know anything about it."
