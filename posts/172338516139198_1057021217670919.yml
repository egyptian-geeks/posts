  Last June, we had an idea to share the knowledge we gained during internships throughout our university study between us - my class of computer science senior students - to prepare each other for industry ( https://www.facebook.com/MuhammadBassem1/posts/10205425542092454 ).
  Last semester we prepared a kind of curriculum and started those sessions and decided to have a weekly session. We had four sessions so far and will continue next semester isA. I thought that it may be a good idea to share the slides we have so far with you as it may be helpful to some.
