  I have some questions regarding Internships for undergrads in Egypt.
  as a freshman studying computer science, I was told to focus on building a good basis and focus on studying algorithms and data-structures and practice problem solving instead of diving into technology and the practical side at least for my first 3 years.

  now I'm on my second year and I haven't picked a technology yet and I focused more on learning the theoretical CS, this year I was searching for an internship for the summer and I found that most of them demand technology knowledge more than you having the good basis in CS and I end up having nothing to put in my resume. They demand you to have experience with a given frameworks! or a very very specific part in a language!. but what I was told before that companies that offer internships need someone with a good basis and they will teach him their technology, but this is not the case on the ground.

  I feel like I am missing many opportunities because I don't have a distinct identity in the field (e.g NodeJS back-end dev, Swift iOS dev, Android dev, etc) by which I'd be able to apply for internships now, especially at a very promising company like Instabug. I want to land an internship while being undergrad and try to experience the real world environment asap without wasting any time.

  This makes me question if I should stop focusing on the what I've been doing and try to catch-up as fast as possible with whatever track I choose and balance things out? or should I stick with what I've been told earlier (focusing on the CS, Algorithms, etc) ?

  I've shortlisted some tracks that I have the sense that they fit me and my passion and I am confident that given any track I pick I'd be able to learn it and hopefully perform good and excel.

  It's my own dilemma and I don't know how should I balance between learning the technology and CS? should I care less about the undergrad internship?, so what are your thoughts ? I really appreciate the experiences in the group and your opinion will help me alot :D

      you are on the right way, continue what you do and about internships, so as Yousef Hamza said the problem is "it's a startup" so if you want to get an internship without the need of technologies, you can apply at Microsoft ATL, Valeo, Orange labs,..etc.
      note that those companies located at Cairo so if you search for an outside internship, you will find more and more.

      Typically, students do internships in the 3rd year not in 2nd one. My advice, focus in your first 2 years (and summer vacations) on programming, OOP, data structures and algorithms (participate in competitive programming). Do several console projects and push code on GitHub. This will play a role in being a strong engineer in the future. The market already has many weak people, don't be one of them.

      In the 3rd year, start to learn technologies (e.g. web basics and sql basics). Again, do projects with what you learn. Better, don't start with frameworks, work lower level first (e.g. In J2ee, be good in JSP/Servlets, before using a framework such as JSF), this makes you more robust.

      Most of the cases were people do internships in 2nd year are for people know programming already before university (e.g. participate in IOI). If this is not the case, it is then much harder.
