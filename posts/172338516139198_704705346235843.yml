      basically run J2ME apps, same thing with the cheap phones that is almost everywhere,
      even in USA until this moment there is devices with very limited abilities and
      there is internet packages for 2G services, \n\nI am with the side of \"Do J2ME
      apps if it serve you\", it will be useless if you did it for business that doesn't
      make sense to have it, like Jewelry app for J2ME or something like that."

      It's not as easy as the author describes it. J2ME market is larger,  but how much money is in it? AFAIK, WhatsApp launched J2ME app after they launched other versions. What if they launched J2ME first & nobody used it because there are no customers in it? What if they launched 4 years earlier when the mobile internet arena was much smaller?

      This article is a great sample for oversimplification.

      Man, you need to set your priorities and know the type of thing you do, For instance I think Egyptian users are on facebook so it is much better and easier to do Facebook App for your users.
      When it gets bigger you go with it, in short "go Lean", sense where it is going and move with it, don't resist or put your ego in the way of your business, this is what this guy trying to say.
