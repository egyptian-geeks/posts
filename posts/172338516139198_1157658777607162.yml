  IPSC is a very cool online annual programming contest. The cool thing about it is that problems are not just algorithmic. I remember some included looking at the waveform of a given audio file, a problem with no statement, debugging some HTTP headers of the problem's page, writing a program to play a JS game, etc.. You can have a look on the problems archive and you'll understand what I mean. Also you can join the contest as a team. Here's the invitation email :

  "Your favorite programming competition is back for its 18th year! We excitedly invite you to compete in IPSC 2016.

  Internet Problem Solving Contest is an online programming competition for teams of up to three people. The problems range from easy to very hard, so everyone is welcome to compete. We also have separate ranklists for individuals and secondary school students. You can use any programming language, or even solve problems by hand. Most of the problems are algorithmic in nature, but IPSC is particularly known for its unusual and fun problems.

  IPSC 2016 will take place on Saturday, 18 June 2016 from 11:00 to 16:00 UTC. Visit http://ipsc.ksp.sk/ to register, either as an individual or as a team of up to three people.

  While you're waiting for 18 June 2016, you can also visit http://ipsc.ksp.sk/train/ to practice on problems from previous years of IPSC.

  If you like IPSC, help us spread the word! Tell your friends, classmates, coworkers, internet strangers, et cetera.

  Good luck in the contest, and have fun!
