    message: I don't think that it's spam. Amazon Music is a division of Amazon. And
      yes, recruiters can hunt you down through you online presence (linkedin profile,
      blog posts, participation in online programming competitions, open source contributions
      etc).

      Jeff is a real amazon recruiter and they are in Egypt recruiting for their team.
      The book depositary is an English company with an Alexandria office, acquired by amazon couple of years ago.

    message: Usama Fayez Mahmoud Said Michel Aguib my point is that I'm still undergraduate
      and I have already stated that in my LinkedIn profile! yet the message states
      that the recruiter came across my profile and offers a "full time senior software
      engineer" position!! thats why I wonder if recruiters are sending job offers
      arbitrarily on LinkedIn. am I missing something here?!

      He maybe missed the grad thing, he only looks up the skills section...
      Anyway, I assure you he is the real deal, and this is an initial communication, no harm would be done in responding ...

      Yeah he may have missed the graduation date ..
      But this is not an offer yet, it's only an initial chat regarding a possible opportunity. Expect to receive such messages regularly on LinkedIn.
