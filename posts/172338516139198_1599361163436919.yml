message: "Hello geeks :D,\nI'm trying to write a simple AR app in ReactNative, it
  should simply see 4 predefined markers and draw a rectangle as a boundary on the
  live preview of the camera, the thing is I'm trying to do the processing in C++
  using opencv so as to have the logic of the app in one place accessible to both
  Android & IOS.\nhere's what I've been thinking \n1. write the OS dependent code
  to open the camera and get permissions in (java/ObjC) & the C++ part to do processing
  on each frame.\n2. call the C++ code (from within the native code) on each frame,
  and that should return lets say coordinates for the markers.\n3. draw the rect if
  4 markers found on the preview in native code.\n4. expose that preview to ReactNative
  (Not sure about that or how to achieve it)\n\nI've looked at the react native camera
  component but it doesn't provide access to frames & if that's even possible, I'm
  not sure if it would be a good idea to send frames over the bridge between JS &
  java/ObjC. \n\nthe problem is that I'm not sure of the performance or if that is
  even possible.\n\nif you know of any ReactNative library that would be great."

      Actually getting the frames from react native isn't a good idea even if it is possible.

      You can develop entirely  your app in c++ or c# (check visual studio 2017 tools)

      If you want to stick to react use react vuforia plugin.
