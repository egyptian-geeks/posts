    message: "the problem is that market have a really short supply of these skilled
      individuals and they tend to be self employed or work in security-focused companies
      , so the market goes to the second best \n\nanother reason is that certificates
      give the recruiters a straightforward method to measure skills otherwise you
      cant really easily filter good candidates especially if you are high profile
      company (not necessarily a tech-related one) and have an open position related
      to infosec"

    message: They didn't actually propose a solution... Certification is worthless...
      Fine... That's kind of true across the board in IT... What *does* work? What
      do the hackers extraordinaire and firmware gurus recommend? How do I know, as
      an Enterprise, that the guy I am interviewing did not spend 7 years in the mountains
      of Afghanistan playing Tetris?

    message: As with everything, it depends of whether you really learn the material
      or just study to take a certificate. You could get certified and actually learn
      along the way, that in my experience has been a great boost to my career.
