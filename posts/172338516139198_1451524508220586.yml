    message: "the problem is that market have a really short supply of these skilled
      individuals and they tend to be self employed or work in security-focused companies
      , so the market goes to the second best \n\nanother reason is that certificates
      give the recruiters a straightforward method to measure skills otherwise you
      cant really easily filter good candidates especially if you are high profile
      company (not necessarily a tech-related one) and have an open position related
      to infosec"

    message: They didn't actually propose a solution... Certification is worthless...
      Fine... That's kind of true across the board in IT... What *does* work? What
      do the hackers extraordinaire and firmware gurus recommend? How do I know, as
      an Enterprise, that the guy I am interviewing did not spend 7 years in the mountains
      of Afghanistan playing Tetris?

    message: As with everything, it depends of whether you really learn the material
      or just study to take a certificate. You could get certified and actually learn
      along the way, that in my experience has been a great boost to my career.

      The certification it self is not the problem, its the teaching/learning/examination methods that is the problem!

      Those kinds of certs. require onsite training, direct observation allowability to let the tutored one to set his own paths as long as he gets things done...this alone insure the real knowledge and real set of skills he has/developed.

      But, it always comes to the $$$ before the knowledge it self....aka commercialised and branded production of useless dreams and fantasies of security..even the dead are not secure! their parts gets ripped of if its fresh :D
