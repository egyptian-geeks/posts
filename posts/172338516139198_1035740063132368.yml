message: "Hello guys,,\nI'm facing problem while developing some models using Unity
  Script c# when i  create  Mesh \"Cube\" i got empty scene\nAfter testing and debugging
  i knew it's about  protection level \nSetting the protection to Public and i got
  empty scene with no objects but variables are their and i can put values in them
  but i want to be dynamically \nIt works if i set protection to protected and set
  initial values but i want to edit them during run time and reading some data using
  XML file \nany idea why i'm getting this issue or anything i can do to solve this
  issue \nwould be appreciated"

      You want to create a bunch of cubes in different positions?
      Then create a prefab that contains that Cube with all other things you want to add to it (like a Box Collider maybe?), then write a MonoBehavior that takes an instance of that prefab and then just Instantiate clones of that prefab with whatever position you want.
      If you don't know what prefabs are, watch this: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/editor/prefabs-concept-usage

      well then, in this case you'd need to create a MeshFilter manually and give it all the Vertex Data (position, normal, texcoord, etc.), you need to know a bit of low-level knowledge to do this.
      I personally never did this before in Unity, but I did it in XNA/MonoGame.

      So are you trying to make more than one MeshRenderer reference the same MeshFilter, or more than one MeshFilter referencing the same Mesh?
      BTW sorry for not being able to understand your question initially, the wording wasn't clear.

      Why are you using a Cube when you need to see a different shape each time?
      Try putting a MeshFilter on the game object but have the Mesh property set to null (press the circle thing and choose "none"), then in your Start method, do something like:
      MeshFilter.mesh = new Mesh();
      then set the veticies, uv, and triangle properties on that mesh.
      Check this link: http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.html

      Then you need to have more than one game object, because you can't have more than one renderer on the same game object!

      yes, now you do:
      filter.mesh = new Mesh();
      then do as explain in the link I sent, also don't forget to set newObj.transform to something that you can see.
      You could debug this as it is running by looking at all these new "Cube" game objects that will show up in the Scene :)

      well in order to draw more than one object, you need to make more than one game object that has its own MeshFilter and MeshRenderer, but you can probably have them share the same Mesh object.
      Sure, try to send me a message, FB might not notify me, but I will receive it
