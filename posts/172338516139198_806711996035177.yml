      1- what type of websites are we talking about? (news-media-social-reports-shopping-etc)
      2- visits per day?
      3- are the DB operations mostly reads or writes?
      4- how many servers for the web/db?
      5- Connection utilization between the DB & web instances. (I've seen times when the problem was that the 100MB connection was saturated, and upgrading to a 1 Gbit connection has solved certain problems).
      6- have you evaluated the executed SQL queries using tools like "SQL Server Tuning Advisor"?
      7- snapshot of the average resources allocation of each server (web-db) covering CPU average %, Ram,network.

      you don't have to reveal all these info on public :), if you prefer we may have a phone call and let's discuss it over there.
      if it's fine to report these points here, kindly let me know your feedback, and ISA we gonna have a discussion to reach the perfect solution for your scenario :)

    message: "first of all you must understand that the concept of CDN is depend on
      site has multi geographical visitors. so I don't know who you target. as if
      you building custom cdn is quite expensive. and is most used for videos hosting
      site. but if is news or just html data and you have china in your concern as
      visitors so then you need build distribution caching server in China.\n\nand
      if what you looking is hardware availability to reduce cpu loads etc ... in
      this case you need load balancer either with hardware or/and software \n\nand
      if you looking for network solution high availability like 100% in this case
      is more expensive and still need to be managed by network designer for each
      datacenter you gonna to host at.\n\nyour question is really very open and I
      believe is not  asp.net question or any developing related question. this what
      network engineer and sys admin do. if you're not a sys admin you better work
      with someone then who can advise you more and give you tailored solution on
      demand of what you required"

    message: CDNs have benefits beyond geo distributed visitors. You still offload
      the work of serving files to different machine. Browser can request only 6 files
      simultaneously from a single point. Add the traffic associated with the CDN
      file.. You get the picture

    message: if you want to reduce load or making high availability you can make load
      balancer or many other solutions. but when it comes to cdn so is same concept
      but with multi location all over the world which is more expensive than single
      location hosting
