      Here are my thoughts

      1. I like the idea & design. What I'm missing is: what would make a normal user register in your site & ignore similar websites, e.g. pinterest, delicious, etc? This is the most important question that you need to answer.

      2. You're doing a good job of caching images, progressive loading of "pens", using S3, but there are still some issues related to performance.

      3. On this page http://www.pensqr.com/8/k_roushdy/, the background image takes a lot of time to load, because it's 1.5MB. Also, png is not the correct format for such an image. IMHO, the best is to use CSS gradient.

      4. Your bundled JS file contains multiple copies of the used libraries (classie, bootstrap, jQuery form, etc).

      I hope the best for you, guys

      1. The difference was not clear
