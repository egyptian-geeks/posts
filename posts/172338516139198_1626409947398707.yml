message: "Good morning everyone. I have been developing with Angular 1 for about 3
  years now, and I find it to be awesome! Now I am trying to explore more with libraries
  like Angular 2/4 and React. I find them both to be very interesting, but the one
  thing I don't understand is that why the people behind React chose to go with one-way
  binding and the state management hassle, instead of doing things the way Angular
  does it; with watchers and digest cycles. \n\nWith React I need to tell the app
  to render over and over again, but with Angular, it does this for me whenever it's
  necessary and I don't need to state-manage anything! So, let me put it simply: why
  React adopts the one-way binding style by default?!"

    message: React is just the 'V' of the 'MVC'. Usually, it's accompanied by something
      like Redux or MobX to handle state for you.
