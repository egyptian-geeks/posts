  SA,
  I'm having an ethical question regarding software engineering..
  If I was working in company 'x', and I learned an approach a to solve a problem, and then I moved to company 'y'. Is it ethical to use the same approach to solve a similar problem?

  EDIT::
  Guys, I'm talking about some situation when this specific approach to the problem is considered the competitive advantage of the company.
  If you know the best approach (that you learned in the first company); will you implement it ?

    message: It depends on a simple clear thing. If you don't have any NDA that specifically
      prohibits you from using such defined approach and you can't be pursued legally..
      if so, I think you should do it with a clear conscience. Even more, you are
      obligated to do the best of what you can in your current company.

      In my opinion, should be ok as long as you can re-create it again in the new team from scratch using only the knowledge in your head. My reasoning for that is simple: you basically cannot "unlearn" knowledge, you're human!

      I could be totally wrong, it's just an opinion, but imagine it this way: if it's a proprietary, confidential solution / algorithm that is a real competitive edge, you would not be able to carry over the knowledge over without doing something obviously wrong like spending day and night to memorize or take a copy of it, etc...

      Maybe it's not ethical if you didn't use your knowledge to serve the company
      you're working in
