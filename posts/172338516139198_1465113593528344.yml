  For people who are working on "Atlassian" products especially "Confluence".
  Do you have noticed any abnormal behavior, like some times links did not work after publishing the changes?

      Unfortunately I can't avoid Atlassian products. I have to deal with it.

      I got this email couple of days ago.
