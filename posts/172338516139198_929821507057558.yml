      My advice: a game developer IS as developer after all
      How is you programming and logic skills?
      work on these skills then begin with exploring easy game development studios like Unity3D or Unreal Engine etc.
      Have fun, make a team and be creative :)

    message: 2. try and figure out WHAT about game programming you like. AI is very
      different from networking, audio is very different from graphics and animations
      are very different from physics... and that is all without mentioning generalists
      / gameplay & tools programmers. Figure out which field you like and start looking
      into that

    message: 3. brush up on your low level skills. Do you know what happens to your
      variables down at the hardware level? Do you know how your functions are mapped
      in the memory? Can you take a wild guess at what your assembly looks like? If
      the answer is no to any of these work on making it a yes

    message: 4. Brush up on your maths. Algebra, calculus, spacial geometry, trigonometry,
      linear algebra (vectors, matrices & quats). Basically, if you think you know
      enough math, it means you dont. Can you work out the formula for the intersection
      of a sphere and a vector? Do you know how to project a shadow? go figure them
      out

    message: 5. Learn how to profile each area of your code properly and figure out
      where the bottlenecks are. Learn how to find out if your code is cpu bound /
      gpu bound / input bound or display latency bound.
