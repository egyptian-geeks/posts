    message: "Hi Ibrahim \nAt first I am not understand your question well and I will
      be appreciate if you more clarify your question. Second I have not experience
      in this condition but I will try to help you and I will answer based on my assumption
      that I understand your question right. Now you have the data I assume that you
      get it in geoJson or Kml and you want to filter data based on types (points,
      lines, polygons, etc.) I think you will not have a problem with this all you
      need is to check the type of the return object and put it in right position(type-list)
      but if you want to filter the data to remove redundant data that if you get
      data from multiple resource you should make your own algorithm to get redundant.
      I wish that I am not (bafty) :D"

    message: Amr Eldib what i meant of map canvas is just the div where the map live
      not a specific api , what you have showed is interesting but not what i need
      , i want a drop down list which allow the user to choose from  a certain properties
      to filter the data according to that , but i'm not sure about the data type
      i should use as you know " esri have their own feature service " and other apis
      works with geojson etc .
