message: Questions for software developers who are in management positions in Egypt,
  When hiring developers in the past year, how easy was it to find full stack web

  is this your impression as well?

      of the market, and freshmen are moving towards front end more, like Angular
      and React.\n\nI think you are doing it other way round, what do you need ? Or
      are you doing market statistics ?"
