    message: What I really loved about EF is the new feature introduced in 4.1 called
      "Code First". Using "Code First" you can start right away with your model classes
      and proceed to other coding tasks without even having a DB. The framework then
      will build the DB for you in Run time. The best part however is thanks to the
      automated DB Data initialization support I was able to very easily write integration
      tests for my DAL and I was able to examine my design from the very beginning.
      Any comments?

    message: "I used many ORMs and there is nothing as \"best\" or \"worst\". LLBLGen
      Pro is easy, well-designed & powerful but expensive (300 USD). NHibernate is
      free & powerful but requires sometime to work well with it. Linq2Sql is easy
      but generates slow queries. \n\nI had the worst experience with Entity Framework.
      It lacks lazy loading, which makes something like\n\n    student.Class.Teachers\n\ntakes
      5 lines instead of 1. It generates large & unnecessarily complex queries, and
      it can take 2 minutes to generate a query of (60KB of size!!!), which takes
      only 2 seconds to execute in Sql Server. (This is my experience)\n\nI used to
      always advice against using Entity Framework, but now I suggest that you make
      a comparison between different ORMs & choose what suits you better. I suggest
      you put these into your account\n\n1. Code-first scenarios"
