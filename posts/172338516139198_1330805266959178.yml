  Guys I cannot receive a Paypal payment the sender got a message saying "Your recipient is not able to receive funds at this time. Your recipient must first setup his / her account to receive funds."
  Is there anyone got this problem before.
  I'm not trying to withdraw here I'm trying to receive, and my account is verified.
