      Let me drop my bomb, I have done my own storage solution for mobile. (It has some problems)

      My Solution vs SQLite
      insertion faster 72 times , retrieval 100 times.

      The fun part it has no query language just callback to filter what you want in 2 modes (sequential and binary with comparator)

      It supports in memory query (it loads all files in the memory and query form it)
      it uses multi indexes (non clustered index) for all the rows except for string based

      It uses string dictionary to minimize the size of the string fields, in short I store array of indexes pointing to the string in a dictionary (it is fast enough that you will not feel that this string is being constructed on the fly)

      There is some open source libraries for Speech recognition + Siri engine it self is open for use (I think you just need to put their logo on your product)
      This is Dragon SDK for Windows.

      Also I never tried to play with Google "Undocumented" Speech Recognition APIs (It is something used with Google voice Input for Android and Google Now in Chrome browsers)
