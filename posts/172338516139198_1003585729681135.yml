      We're mostly developers here so I assumed I didn't have to say "R&D Developer" or something like that.
      And yeah it is a bit generic (which is surprisingly a good thing), one day I would be learning how to program an Arduino, next I'd be learning about DRM and audio encoding :D
      So far I've done, IoT (Arduino and Pi), data visualization, and audio encryption :)

      Edit: it seems that they finally enabled comment replies in groups, didn't notice that on the phone :S

      Edit 2: I guess the main difference between what I do now and what I used to do in previous jobs (other than being more generic), is that I don't care as much about the final product, I just prototype then move to the next thing.
