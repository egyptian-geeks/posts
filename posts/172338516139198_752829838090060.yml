      you can consider it like the difference between using native php and php framework, a well structured platform with new possibilities to code powerful front-end apps with ease

       when you get start with angular JS you will understand the concept about it

    message: "Vanilla php vs a php framework is a wrong analogy and if he can't wrap
      his head around ajax then I wouldn't expect him to grasp jquery.\n\nThe idea
      is simple Ahmed Tarek, ignore angularjs for now. Let's take a look at how the
      web works from a bird's eye view.\n\nYou got a web browser, let's say Firefox.
      You got a web server, somewhere around the world. It's hosting a website, let's
      call it thewebrocks.tld\n\nNow, Mr. Foobar decided he will visit thewebrocks.com,
      so he opened his Firefox, typed thewebrocks.tld then... he waited.\n\n.. still
      waiting\n\n.. he has a slow connection, nothing is showing up yet, he's still
      waiting\n\n.. now he thinks TEData did the deed, and cut off his Internet.\n\nAha!!
      Finally, the website loads.\nWhat happed was Firefox sent a \"synchronous\"
      request to the web server that hosts thewebrocks.tld\n\nAnd it waited for a
      reply, blocking everything. Showing nothing until the whole thing loads.\n\nSomeone
      at Microsoft in the 90s came up with a brilliant idea (this is a rare occasion
      in Microsoft, we're grateful) of \"asynchronous\" requests. That is, to send
      a request in the background and forget about it.\n\nUntil the request is complete,
      the website (thewebrocks.tld) and the browser are free to do anything else they
      want.\n\nHence the name, Ajax = Asynchronous Javascript and xml, aka making
      browsers suck less.\nWhat happens is, using Javascript you can send asynchronous
      http requests to a server and then continue whatever else you were doing.\n\nHow
      is this any different than angularjs, jquery, emberjs, knockout, backbonejs,
      spinejs? There's no relation between them.\n\nAjax is just a fancy set of technologies
      to make asynchronous requests less painful, it's a communication model, it's
      a way through which your client side code would communicate with a server.\n\nAngularjs
      and the likes are frameworks, a framework is a set of reusable components, libraries
      and functions that abstract away concepts like data binding, view templates
      (reusable html bits), server communication, event handling, code organization...etc.
      \n\nIf after reaching to this line, you still have issues understanding then
      you're shit outta luck.\n\nGood luck."

      It most certainly does, unless you included some resource in your page's head that was blocking the flow, eventually not being able to read the body tag. That was only a simplification of the synchronous communication model, that it happens _now_ and you _actively_ wait for it.

      As opposed to it happening in the background and being notified about its status with a callback mechanism of some sort, in the case of asynchronous models.

    message: "AJAX is loading some parts of the page in the background, or posting
      data (if needed) and getting results in the background. \n\nBrowsers give you
      APIs to do that. Some JS frameworks like jQuery and Angular.JS give you nicer
      APIs that wrap the browser one, and give you more features in general which
      differ by framework. \n\njQuery for example allows you to get a nicer API for
      communicating with DOM (HTML elements) in your JS code. Angular.JS gives you
      an API to handle this communication for you so rhat you don't have to write
      it at all (in most cases, and keep the code that talks to DOM for the rest of
      the cases).\n\nWhen it comes to API both jQuery and Angular.JS have features
      like intercepting all requests and defereed/promie (a way to chain multiple
      success/error handlers) , etc. Angular.JS API integrates with the rest of Angular.JS
      features of course if you prrfer the DOM to be handled for you to have cleaner
      code.\n\nGoogle \"$.ajax\" and \"$http\" for syntax differences"
