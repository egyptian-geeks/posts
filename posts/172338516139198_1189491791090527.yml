message: "For those unfamiliar with spring and who don't get what I mean when I say
  Spring has it all. A few times I see people confusing C# and the .NET Framework
  comparing it to just plain Java language with it's base libraries. What would make
  more sense is understanding that each of these languages runs on an entire platform,
  which can talk to each other and inter-operate.  \n\nSo for those who would like
  to experience for themselves I share this list if guides.\n\nhttp://spring.io/guides\n\nI
  recommend with building a restful web service. All the tools, all the libraries
  and even the IDE is absolutely free and all of it is less that 800 MB :)"
