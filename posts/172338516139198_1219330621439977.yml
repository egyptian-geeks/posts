  in a cross road & i had to choose between ( reactjs & ng2 ) & i chose reactjs &
  redux. \n\nnow after reviewing angular 2 as well i find my self comfortable with
  both of them. but i still can't make up my mind. \n\nI really really dig ng2 & fell
  it's faster & i don't have to write as much as i do in reactjs. \nI fell there is
  a lot of limitation that i have with redux that i don't have with ng2. \ni really
  think ng2 is simpler & faster.\n\nmy question is: what's your chosen framework ?
  \n& is there any real advantage in reactjs that isn't in ng2 ?"

      I've been using Angular since started, and I think Angular II represents the maturity level required to make it the flavored choice.

      I gave ReactJS multiple trials, and in every time I feel like I'm missing something. I've never been comfortable with it :)

      Even when building a cross platform App, unless you're a performance-freak :D, you'll find ionic the complementary framework.

      I think, you can use ReactJS in the way it was presented as a cross platform framework, but when it comes to scalable large-scale web Apps, you may go with Angular (y)

      You do not have to choose one.
      You can do a project with that, another with this, and list both in your CV, since you truly and genuinely learned both.

      I'm working with a team in very large company in Australia with huge IT department. We are building something with Angular 2, and the team is evaluating React because existing teams are using either Angular 1 or React (because Angular 2 wasn't as stable as it's in RC5 today) and we thought it might be nice if we use the same tech.

      And guess what? Having watched a few Redux videos etc I was able to help the sub-team evaluating React myself. Admittedly many of their problems were Webpack related though, which you get to deal with in both worlds.

      We haven't settled on a winner yet, but the team agrees they are very close (especially if you add NGRX/Store to the mix as an equivalent of Redux).

      One adv Angular 2 has (for this specific case) is that it seems more friendly for long term projects. In 2-3 years maybe Redux won't be the big thing like Flux isn't (might be replaced by MobX or something totally new), but Angular 2 will likely be there, with styleguide that makes joining the project and working with it pretty easy and relevant.

      Beware though that this concern is specific to large enterprises. If it's a small project then why not work with the hottest thing in the corner and when something even nicer comes out just move to it and get the benefits? That's the idea of the React community, and it's frankly awesome.

      So, my advice is: if you did a lot of stuff with React / Redux, do something with Angular 2, and have booth tools in your toolbox. You honestly do not have to choose.

    message: "If this question was asked in stackoverflow it will be closed as it
      is opinion-based ;-). \nAnyway, I have another strategy to learn such technologies:\n1-
      Don't! \n2- When the technology gains some traction, I just play with it to
      know its use cases and the difference between its alternatives...etc. no deep
      learning here, just scratching the technology surface.\n3- When I faced a use
      case, I lookup my technology toolbox for the best fit.\nSome years ago, I was
      plugging new technologies in every project, even if the technology is not mature
      enough. I cannot think of any reason of doing so except to put it in my CV!
      Shame on me:(\nIf you find yourself follow what is called \"Resume-Driven Development\",
      Don't!\n-------\nHere are some other considerations for angular vs react:\n1-
      If you have time: know both\n2- Angular has more traction in Egypt and Gulf
      market (this is a gut feeling, I have no evidence on it)\n3- It's OK to feel
      comfortable with one technology that the other. Personally, When I started playing
      with react, I didn't like the idea of starting with js and generating html from
      it. I feel more comfortable with the angular way, may be because I learned it
      first. Maybe it is in my comfort zone:)\n3- Angular 1 is mature, but have problems,
      especially performance. Angular 2 is simpler, and - hopefully - promises better
      performance.\n4- Don't use angular 2 in any serious enterprise application,
      it is still not released (I know it is RC5 now). It's OK with trivial apps.
      As per react, I can't tell; I just scratched its surface!"
