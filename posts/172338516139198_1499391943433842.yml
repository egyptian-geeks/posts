  We have a web service that communicates with and pulls data from multiple, say 5, 6 or even 10K, databases. Each database has its very own design, tables and columns but they all implement a "Users" table. Our web service must look in each of those "Users" tables and access their data.

  Question is, how to manage such number of database connections/contexts taking into account the different names of the "Users" table and its columns' in each DB.

  Any suggestions would be appreciated :)

      When u say access data in users table.. What do u mean ?
      Can u write expected outcome?

      Just to give u heads. Up. What u r discriping is a common activity in any saas company that serve single tenant systems.
      You need to create ur own db and this db will hold what is known as "meta-data" this meta data is composed from 10,000k db.
      But i need to understand what data are u extracting and outputing to give a better advice

      Sounds like an ETL job
      not an expert here, but I think u will find tools that define the mapping for the table and column names, and it will handle injestion of data and everything

      as i understood and  maybe wrong you need to READ from 10 k database , and those 10 K database are under your management,so
      Why Pull , Push Instead  !!!! Create a Pipe Line with A Listener and Make The The Database's as  your subscribers ....so instead of 10 k config , a single config maybe a script to do the push on the 10 k

      Its is going to be time/money consuming  to implement event sourcing or any type of events in the other system or even to ask for an api on trigger. You can check a product called Microsoft FIM (forefront identity manager) or any similar product to sync the data into a single table and this table is going to be your read table. If FIM is not option I see an ETL is a good option but your customer must understand that there will be some delay between your read db and their databases, if they want real data then you have to do events.

      Try to check ETL products first before thinking about going custom code.
      Good luck

      I don't know which programming Framework you're using, but in such a case I would use something based on scripting language like TypeScript.

      If this is the case, all you need to have is a very simple JSON mapping from your names to the target database names. If you're offering this as a service to your clients, you can ask them, using a wizard, to do that mapping.

      Your class should have one generic function for each CRUD operation.

      The flow will be as follows:
      . Choose the database you'll be connecting to
      . Read the connection string and the mapping JSON
      . Convert the mapping to a DB query
      . Execute and return the results

      Another solution if you're using a compiled language, is to directly format the mapping to CRUD Operation command, into a SQL Query for example. Assume that you're looking for two fields, username and fullname. If db1 columns are, uname and fname, the queries will look like:
      Select uname as username, fname as fullname from TABLEdb1
      And you keep changing the uname, fname and TABLEdb1 for each DB Configuration.

      If your logic isn't that simple, and you need more actions like special validations and so on, you might need to have one Interface, and implement an inheriting class for each db.
