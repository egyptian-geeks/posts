    message: It does not make much sense to "use GPU instead of CPU". GPUs can be
      used to perform certain tasks. What are you trying to achieve?

    message: To use the GPU for processing you need a relevant toolchain like opencl.
      You don't just run normal code on the GPU since it has a different way of doing
      things. Unless you are doing graphics (then your graphics library should probably
      be GPU accelerated), you need to use a GPU toolchain like opencl (Nvidia has
      one for its gpus as well but I don't remember the name).

      There is something called General Purpose GPU (GPGPU), and I remember there were some efforts in the .net community to make .net libraries for CUDA/OpenCL, I think this was one of the promising ones, however it hasn't been updated for almost 2 years

    message: Try CUDA or Opencl, CUDA's learning curve is less steep, but it can only
      be used on Nvidia GPUs, while opencl's learning curve is more steep but it can
      be used on any vendor card gpu and even on cpus
