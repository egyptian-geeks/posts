  - description: "Create Matrix Like screen using Ruby\n\nthe idea is that this screen
      is a vertical lines each line\nmoves vertically in random speed.\n\neach line
      has number of entities, each entity has a random \ncharacter with random size.\n\neach
      character is will be changed randomly, \nso we created an entity class with
      this features \nthen created the vertical lines of them has the same number
      \nof characters but with different speeds.\n\nand let them roll..\nafter creating
      it i noticed that it changed to new character\nby 60 change per second (the
      FPS) so i had to invent a small technique\nto skip some second for the character
      changing.\n\ni could have been changed the FPS to lower value but this will
      slow\ndown the lines movement, so to keep lines moving smoothly i kept FPS \nhigh
      anad skipped random number of frames using a entity class member\nupdate_limit
      and last_update\n\nGist: https://gist.github.com/9584057"
