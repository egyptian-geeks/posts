  Any Windows 10 Fans here? Any body is enrolled in the Windows Insider Preview Program? I want to know how stable is it. Is it suitable to use it on my work machine or it could break?

  Asking specifically cause an upcoming update looks amazing and worth to try :)

    message: The most annoying "feature" ever, is having to select your active hours,
      to give Windows permission to do auto-update and reboot the system anytime outside
      these hours.

    message: "I've been running the Insider Previews for the last year and I haven't
      had any major problems. I'm running on the 'Slow' ring for updates. Probably
      the only problem I had was that sometimes when I double click on a folder to
      open it, it just opens in a new window instead of using the existing one. That
      has been fixed with The Creators update though. \n\n3D Paint and viewer are
      really cool. I got to try them when I was working on a game for uni. It worked
      pretty well for a beta. I haven't tried the streaming and gaming stuff yet as
      the update just rolled out a few days ago."

      I also advise not to install it on your primary laptop, an insider build that's not stable or has incompatible driver could cost you time to install or recover Windows 10 again. Do it on secondary machine if you want to try it.

      Side note, Creators update looks promising.

      When my PC was working, I used to install insider builds from the "Slow" ring, and they were very stable for everyday use and development. Now I'm installing builds from the Slow ring on my old laptop, but I haven't been paying too much attention to it so I can't say how stable they are.
      For the "Fast" ring, I've seen many videos summarizing new features in builds on the Fast ring, and I noticed that there is significantly more bugs on them, but I don't think they would make the OS unstable, but more like unpleasant or annoying ya3ni.
      an BTW you can roll back to normal builds at any time as long as you don't delete the backup with the disk cleanup tool.
