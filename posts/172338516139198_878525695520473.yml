    message: That equates "cleverly-written" (code) with "hard to understand". That's
      wrong; clever code is code simple enough to understand/maintain while still
      solving the problem at hand.

    message: Cleverly in this contact means "you have reached the limit of your intelligence
      to write it", therefore the sentence would make sense. It is kind of a corollary
      of "Keep It Simple and Stupid" :)
