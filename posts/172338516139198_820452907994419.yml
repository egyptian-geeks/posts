      I like the app's UI, but there are two small UI problems:
      The Splash Image needs to have a higher jpeg compression quality (low jpeg quality hurts my eyes)
      and the Ads aren't aligned with the rest of the UI and have a black background which looks weird when the app's background in white.
      (and I think the "about" should be an appbar item not an appbar button, makes more sense this way, but that's just my opinion)
      As for functionality, the app crashed on first start (I don't know why, check the crash logs on the store) but worked on the second time
      The play/pause doesn't work, it doesn't actually pause and it doesn't get un-pressed when the audio has finished playing
      and when I backed out from the about page, the audio played again even though I didn't press play
