  Guys how do you/your company organize the senstive data related to the clients servers, access credentials, servers URLs ... etc
  I have seen companies and people using excel sheets and share it across the employees using Google Drive, using tools like Microsoft One Note, just storing them in plain text files on their desktops ...
  Currently we store the details regarding the projects (like how to kickoff, how to deploy, dependencies ...etc) in a readme file in the root of the repository but we can't save senstive info like that.
  I searched for tools and found some options suggested by the users on http://security.stackexchange.com but I am curious to see if anyone here solved that problem before. I am looking for a solution that makes a central repository and simple to use.
  Edit: forgot to add to be secure too :D
  Thank you.

    message: I use keepassx. It's local, not shared, encrypted with master password,
      and I put its database on an encrypted filesystem. Sharing is a problem, but
      to do sharing properly anyway, you'll need to trust a server.
