message: "Not your typical post, but I'm sure at least some of you will appreciate
  this. The paper that sparked all research in brain-machine interfaces:\n\n\"Real-time
  control of a robot arm using simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex
  \" \n\nChapin et al.,\n\nTL;DR: This is the first published effort to record neuronal
  activity and use it to electronically drive actuators in a robot-arm. The implications
  at the time were that this could lead to prostheses that are directly controlled
  by the brain, and \"feel natural\". There's still *a lot* to be done in that area,
  but things like feedback and bi-directional interfaces have already been demonstrated.
  Meaning, there are now research prosthetic arms with which humans can \"feel\" things
  like touch and finger/palm formation. Things which we take for-granted, but are
  actually critical.\n\nhttps://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490i/07wi/papers/paper011.pdf\n\nEDIT:
  In case you're *really* interested, this review article, though somewhat dated (2006),
  does a decent job at giving an overview of BMIs:\n\nhttps://cs.rochester.edu/~kautz/Courses/290Bspring2008/NeuroRobots/TiNS_2006.pdf"
