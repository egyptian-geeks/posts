  SA,
  I'm working on a reporting web app. I've done a neat UI using bootstrap, while having a big bunch of complex backend.
  The client says it's a "2000 style design". He says it's not "interactive enough", however, he does not have a clear vision of how he wants his web app UI.
  He did not value the hard work done to bring this web app to life, with full functionality.
  Any ideas/advice/suggestions?
  NB: I'm basically a backend developer.

    message: I would say ask a front-end developer and seek his opinion. Then you
      can use it as a proof that you did a good job. Better yet agree with your client
      on an independent third party to evaluate the UI if that is possible.

      IMO this is a communication issue. While I'm sure you put in a lot of hard work, this doesn't necessarily mean what you worked on will meet the client's expectations/requirements.

      Your mistake (and his) was working through this without prototyping/initial designs/anything to get a feel of what's to come. There were a lot of assumptions made on both ends.

      Having a clear vision (I'm assuming you mean a general design theme/sense/etc) is something clients will always suck at - it's not their job tbh. Extracting requirements and making sure everything is compliant is your job, because you're supposed to be the expert here.

      Imagine it like this: if you were redecorating your house, and you got an interior designer to do your house. You said you wanted something "modern" without actually agreeing on what modern meant. If that designer worked on and delivered something that is so not what you're going for, who's to blame?

      "Neat", "good", "bad" - very highly subjective.

      If my opinion is of any value, try to work this out through a detailed (and involved) process. Get them to sign off on prototypes, initial designs, documentation, etc, before you actually do any of the grunt work, so no one's time (or money) is wasted.
