    message: "I think it depends on your goal or what kind of jobs you want to apply
      for in the future. I am not experienced but what I would say:\nmake a list of
      the technologies (maybe the popular ones). read about them and what they offer
      and give the ones that interest you a shot. and if you like like any of them
      you can dive a little deeper.\n\nfor example i will make a list of 10 try 6
      and pick 4 and work on them. \n\nthat's my opinion anyway. why\" you will know
      a couple of technologies that you might need to switch to someday.. and you
      will be able to use a couple of them very good. just like any normal developer-engineer
      whatever.  \n\nAnd Here is a video from an experienced developer on what to
      learn?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBzRwzY7G-k&t=1162s"

      if you are targeting abroad, then target Europe, not US!
      Vacancies in eu is so much wider, specially in germany and the Netherlands!

      if you are going to learn backend, then learn java... it has the biggest career opportunities market!
