    message: "I know it's hard to believe but some of them actually write all the
      recipes from scratch, I work for supermama.me and most of our recipes are written
      by our writers. There are also content companies which give you a seed of content
      that you can build on, IIRC pinterest used one of those companies when they
      were starting out. \n\nOf course some recipes are standard in all cultures,
      countries, kitchens and those are of course copied, (grilled chicken, pasta,
      rice, bla bla bla)"

      I was going to work on some idea related to that, so you have two ways of doing so:
      1- Scraping
      2- There are APIs for recipes

    message: Content builds up through the years. Unlike news articles, recipes don't
      get old and you can keep on bringing them up every once and a while. The more
      followers you have...  the more you can afford to invite more writers. Allrecipes.com
      was founded in 1997, that is almost 19 year *365 days = 6,935 days of content
      building.... multiply that by the number of articles published per day, in addition
      to user generated content :D
