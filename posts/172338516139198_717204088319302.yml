      Worm game in under 50 line of code in ruby

      i enjoyed doing this simple game, it is amazing that
      you can create the games you were playing in your childhood.

      the amazing worm game i were playing on the low-res hand gaming
      device, it is simple in design and logic.

      first you define window dimensions and for the sake of simplicity
      i choose to make it square, also define screen resolution (number
      of squared per vertical/Horizontal line).

      you worm is simple, it consis of number of consecutive pixels,
      and a direction, the screen has a worm part (we call it food)
      worm will move till it hit the part and it joins it to its body
      and the game generates a new food in a random position.

      worm movement is restricted to some simple conditions
      * don't get out of the screen
      * don't hit your self
      if any one of these conditions occure then reset the game.

      script was longer than this one i attached i had to compress
      some lines to suite the image like joining some variables lines
      and join the lines of single line methods this saves 2 lines.

      it was a good challenge i hope to be useful as an overall idea
      for whom of you want to start game development. :)

      try to enhance the script, make it a more awesome game and happy coding :)
