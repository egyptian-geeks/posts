    message: "Good work, I have some notes:\n- In the controller, you define two actions
      index (for the home page of the website) and status (for the JSON API that you
      provide) .. this results in code duplication and sort of bad design choice.
      I would suggest that the index action uses your JSON API directly as a typical
      client (service-url/status), parses the JSON and directs the view to render
      what it wants. \n- I think that the test is fake, right?\n- As you probably
      know, parsing their html is not stable from your API viewpoint, but I think
      this is the only method you have for now ...\n- By the load distribution over
      time, are you going to parse this page MiniCurrentLoadClock2.aspx? I would suggest
      moving your API one step forward and incorporate sort of prediction based on
      the load distribution .. now you provide something, egyptera doesn't provide
      ..\n- Why GPL? :D"

      Nice idea, Converted it into js

      I assume we could predict outage if we have enough data, I don't think it's available from official sources, maybe crowd-sourcing?!

    message: If all tweets were tagged with location, we could map out where the power
      goes out, then maybe figure some trend (maybe they just cut them out in a specific
      order), but I don't think there will be many tweets about power outage that
      are tagged with a location :\
