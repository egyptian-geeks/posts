      Deploy a Firewall on any spare pc you have (pfsense - mikrotik)
      or you can join them with your pc via speedify but you would need to add more lan cards

    message: AFAIK, If you need to increase upload speed, loadbalancing will not help
      you, you will still upload via one ADSL line but download via all lines. To
      achieve more upload speed, you will need ADSL Bonding, ADSL bonging will require
      that you have a server ( outside your network) and all your lines should seamlessly
      upload to this server and this server would then upload to the destination.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_bonding
