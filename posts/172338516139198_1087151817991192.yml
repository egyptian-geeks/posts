  Bottom line is, if you are trying to change someone’s mind, criticism is not an effective way to do it.

  Don't call someone's baby ugly !

    message: "I generally agree with the message in this post - the one that says
      you don't have to be a jerk to disagree with someone - but I also think a lot
      of people in the tech community take a lot of things way too personally. \nWhile
      being mean or overly frustrated at a product/tool is not the most civilized
      way to go about debating its faults, it's not meant (or it shouldn't be meant)
      as an insult to the developer/people behind it. \nIt's not comparable to calling
      someone's baby ugly, even if they did put their \"heart and soul\" into it,
      because unlike an actual baby, the look/feel/performance of a tool you use is
      directly relevant to you, and it can actually be improved."
