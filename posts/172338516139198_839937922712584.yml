    message: I think part of the problem in the java code in this example that Java
      is strictly OOP paradigm you can't really do anything in Java without associate
      it with a class and object.Meanwhile, Python is multiple paradigm and it has
      really a reliable C supported library to get things done with less code.

    message: It's just that python has better API. All this Java can be wrapped in
      a single function call

    message: "I love Python and hate Java, but to be honest, requests is not a built
      in library.\n\nFor a fair comparison -if the java snippet is built in the language-
      he should have used urllib. \n\nAnyway, Python wins ;)"

    message: A programming language is not just about syntax & semantics. The community
      & culture surrounding it are very important. The built-in Python lib (urllib)
      sucks, but the Python community worked to address this problem. On the other
      hand, the Java community tend to like complexity in the name of abstractions.
