      Yousrii May be this help!, line 14 and 15 on first screen shot ... res object is stream object you can't access data directly, you have to listen for data emitted then collect them and assign them to dataCon var ... or use bl (buffer list) module on npm and require it . Try this on line 15:
      res.pipe(bl(function(err, data) {
          this.dataCon = data.toString();
      }));

      The main concept here is that ajax requests are asynchronous by nature and you never really know when it will be resolved.

      In your code you are trying to access the variable before the promise is resolved and thus it's undefined.

      You need to wait for the promise to resolve before trying to use it's data, try the solution suggested by Ahmed Atalla and let us know how it went!

      Dude, u forgot to bind ur fn to class :'(, es6 classes doesn't support autobind, screen 1 line15 this.dataCon refer to this of the caller not the class.
      Tips:- dont bind global vars to ur class, its not how js works, aslo
      Axios is not stream, its a promise based and u r uding if just fine

      This.get = this.get.bind(this):
      Or u can devlare get as,
      Get = () =>{
      ```
      }
       And it will automatically get access to this
