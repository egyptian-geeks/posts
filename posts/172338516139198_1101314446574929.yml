    message: It has been discussed and trialled a few times before. Facebook is where
      the people are, and everyone have their preferences for where to go to stuff
      (from Google Groups to RSS readers to Slack to you-name-it...), and most people
      wouldn't go to an independent site as well. So here remains the one place for
      all for now.
