    message: Have you tried Go? It should be faster than python for most purposes,
      and it's not so hard to learn.

    message: "on why disk write is as fast as ram write, I believe os.write() might
      not write to disk directly, it makes a system call to write the data  to OS
      buffer directly (which is in a ram region described by the file file descriptor
      returned by os.open() also which writes it to disk at some time in the future
      that is not related to your program running time) , to force sync the os buffer
      with disk you need to flush and call os.fsync()\ncheck first comment here \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7127075/what-exactly-the-pythons-file-flush-is-doing\nand
      python os.fsync()  docs\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html\non how to
      achieve maximum write speed, i don't think there is higher writing speed in
      python than using os.open and os.write, but you i think the overhead here is
      all in the data itself, instead of using a string (block) use an array (not
      list)\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html\ni believe that should be
      more efficient."
