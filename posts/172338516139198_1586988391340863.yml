message: "SA folks, I've got a question on FaceNet Paper.\n\nI'd like to ask if this
  paper does take into consideration the intrusion problem \ni.e ( if the model was
  trained on 50 different faces of 50 different persons, what if a new identity/face
  is introduced to the trained model, would it identify it as out of classes or it'll
  try to minimize the distance and find the nearest match face to this identity this
  was somehow mentioned in the paper itself )"

      I checked it myself , intrusion problem haven't been mentioned before.
      But noting that CNN needs to be trained again for each entry.
      (as far as my shallow understanding of machine learning goes)

    message: I don't know the exact architecture of the model but if  "other" class
      doesn't exist you can theoraticaly retrain the last layer with "other" class
      added to the main classes on random faces (transfer learning)
