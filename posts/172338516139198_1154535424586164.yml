message: "Okay, this is a bit irritating. I'm subscribed to Etisalat ADSL, this morning
  my Internet was not working. The ADSL line was working okay and the router showed
  correct upstream and downstream readings. However, the Internet was not working
  because the PPPoE interface was down (not connected). I filed a complaint and after
  a couple of hours the PPPoE was working fine. The irritating part is now whenever
  I try to open a page on any browser (on any device) it shows a notification from
  Etisalat that I can't discard (the continue button call a JS function that should
  redirect me back to the page I wanted but it doesn't work). I called tech support
  and spent 40 minutes trying to explain to some Frontline idiot that my Internet
  connection is fine (I even download router config files from Etisalat's website)
  but with no avail. \nSo is there any way to bypass this redirect mess? \nOr since
  this is PPPoE it is not possible? \n\nThe interesting part is that the only webpage
  that instead of being redirected to the notification page shows connection timeout
  is Facebook. I ran tracert to different Web pages and Facebook seems to have weird
  hops. The rest just kept being directed to the same host (the notification page)."
