message: "Hello,\nI've an android application which connects to my Ruby On Rails application
  and I'm using Nginx as a web server & a free ssl certificate from let's encrypt
  , my application is live on store since last october but suddenly users started
  reporting that the app isn't always working on Etisalat UAE Mobile Data Connection,
  the app works sometimes but sometimes it isn't working, i've started debugging and
  found that when the application isn't working my application sends https requests
  successfully but this request doesn't hit server, i thought it's an ssl issue so
  i've implemented an ssl pinning. but still face the same issues, \nhere's my sslabs
  analysis.\n\nany ideas about this issue? the application is working fine on WIFI
  Connections , the only issue with mobile data from Etisalat UAE , i want to contact
  them but i don't know what to say."
