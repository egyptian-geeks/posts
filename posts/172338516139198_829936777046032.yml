      provide a better alternative to some very important features like two-way binding.

      Angular reminds me of Asp.net WebForms when you used to develop custom controls and take care of their data binding and rendering to make your form code look clean and encapsulate all details into reusable components, however all that was server side only which was pretty broken when you need to encapsulate javascript code too.
      Angular uses almost the same pattern but on client side, with nice testability and Dependency injection support, but I see the potential problems that is inherently comes from that model, too many abstractions each has the potential of leaking some and you end up required to know every detail on how Angular works just to get something a little bit out of the normal pattern to work.\

    message: "I am using Angular for 8 months now in one of the most complicated Web
      Apps I ever worked on where everything is about run-time builders starting from
      defining the business and data models to reports designer and viewer. \nI do
      agree with Daniel on many of the down side points he mentioned in his article,
      but I don't regret using Angular in this project at all. It was for me like
      a life saver, too powerful and easy to use at the same time at least for me.\nI
      don't recommend to use Angular for all web apps. it always depends. In some
      apps I don't even go with JavaScript Apps Frameworks if the server + some jQuery
      can handle the same with reasonable UX"
