  Hello Geeks
  VERY URGENT PLEASE

  I have a website hosted on vps on godaddy , the website has a signup process , in the second step of the signup process which has very little amount of fields including only a poster file upload  and 3 other fields , I tried doing the process from egypt it works fine , from several testers accounts , so after that two accounts from Morrocco and Poland tried to go through the signup process but they failed in the second step , (Ajax request i guess because they said it keep saying loading) i tried to check with a friend in Norway and he was able to go through the signup process normally , what should be the problem is it possible that both of them have a connectivity problem ?? I guess not 　 Please any help
