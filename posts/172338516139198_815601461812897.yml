    message: I'd be interested in how SSL works. I know the guys behind http://readme.localtest.me/
      and at first they got a real certificate but then later CA didn't like what
      they were doing because the private key wasn't secure, and they thought any
      other authority will think the same and gave up on it.

    message: I heard this story as well. I don't know if ngrok solved the SSL problem
      or just the CA didn't revoke certifcate yet :)

    message: You know that with Gulp they have a module that does this for you when
      you start your local server?
