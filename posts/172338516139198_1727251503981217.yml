    message: I can't see the point of going to a platform builder with a mindset of
      saving time and budget and this platform is almost as time consuming as custom
      development... normally it's used in large scale ecommerce website and wordpress
      and opencart for small to medium and custom dev for enterprise ... but for me
      whenever i see that opencart or wordpress woocomerce won't be suitable i take
      a business/ strategic  decision which would be custom dev ... easier to find
      develooers and its something we are used to do anyways and easier to customize
      and scale .

      Magento isn't the thing you can learn easily on your own, no enough free  material, official courses can cost around 350USD so not all companies in Egypt will invest. Magento is not good for small businesses -specially in Egypt- as it'll be so costly full with features useless for such scale.

      finally remote work is now very easy to find. So when we talk about salaries in Egypt and the remote work we find a big gap

      I really can't understand the hate towards Magento :D ?
      Any tool has its pros and cons.

      So to answer your question what are you searching for ?

      Any Php developer can do the job for you developing a plugin/theme for Magento.
