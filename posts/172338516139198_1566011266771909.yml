    message: Too vague of a question. Were you offered an NDA to sign? Was it PDF?
      A link? Do you want to write one? Details please.

    message: "There are different kinds of digital signatures, \n\nThere is signing
      a document digitally, the way you would sign a paper NDA. Tools exist for this
      like Adobe Sign.\n\nAnd there is the digital signature that uses encryption
      to produce some sort of a hash proving that you are indeed the source of the
      file and that it wasn't tampered with by some other part in the middle.\n\nI
      think you are referring to the first, but you have to be more specific."

    message: Some companies send the NDA in a PDF file that's is editable, and in
      this case all you need is to type your name in the field specified for that,
      and maybe fill in a date field as well.

    message: Adobe Acrobat has a feature for signing documents from the menu. It should
      guide you to upload an image of your signature or create a new one.

      Emails are considered binding agreements in court of law. so just exchange emails and mention that these emails are for "Binding to both parties".

      that's enough. for most cases
