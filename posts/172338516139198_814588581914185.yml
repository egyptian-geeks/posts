      Typically JSF 2.0, also Java 7 stack provides out of the box REST support and you may use typical JDBC support
      You may also consider ADF UI & business components (out of the box persistance) for building rapid web applications

      Ahmad Alfy Actually the JVM & servlets are epic when it comes to Webservers xD

      Thanks Guys, i am not debating the JVM as i have no doubt it can handle whatever you throw at it.
      i am just seeking your experience with the requirements i mentioned above.
      i know PLAY! but again, it conflicts with the first requirement (anyways, if i ended up using PLAY! i would have replaced it with Django)

      I would recommend Rails, since you would find a lot of reusable components already made for you, tested by thousands of users and updated daily/weekly for issues (http://rubygems.org). But since your team is already proficient in using Java then I would suggest Play!

      P.S:  I've never seen it in a production environment

      I've few comments on this discussion. Just trying to make few things clear

      1- All due respect, but most people on this group are not working with the Java tech stack. You will get more & better answers if you ask the EGJUG (https://www.facebook.com/EGJUG)

      2- Python is not the "next" best thing! Python is already mature & popular. Actually it's popularity is starting to decline, slowly replaced by nodejs & go, because of its shortcoming related to real-time web apps

      3- If it's OK for _your team_ to work on django, then this is my suggestion for the tech stack
      server-side: django
      restful framework: django-rest-framework
      DB: Postgres
      Data access: default django ORM
      front-end: Angular (sorry Ahmad Alfy)
      App server: gunicorn
      Web server: nginx
      Caching: redis or memcached
      Scalability/Availability/blah-blah-bility: have the problem first, then solve it!

      Why you need Java server side for a one single page app! you are complicating things! Java is Awesome of course but for specific use cases! You can get your restful web services using something very light like Node.JS, Ruby, .NET or even PHP! That's why I don't get you to be honest!

      Java Dominates where is Aplicable when you need a heavy server side Operations or processing. So Don't get a Monster to make a bartender work for example!

      As Mohammad Tayseer Mentioned don't try to solve a problem you don't even have! Never Think of scalability because simply you will not afford it while you are just starting up! Twitter Didn't start Scaling unless they had the need to do it (Remember The Famous Whale Page) I can tell you by experience that scaling infrastructure will cost you at least 5K Dollars a Month **Minimum**

      There is no project that scale in one day! that's absolute bullshit! You keep watching your analytics and measure how people use your application and the business it self will ask you to scale when it's time.

      - Scalable systems doesn't work without thinking in Infrastructure.

      - I think we are not on the same page, Single one Page App is a Single one Page app. I'm not sure about what kind of app you are trying to make here but even though using java for your backend to consume it on the front end is not the best stack. May be you can share with us what;s the problem you are trying to solve here (Not Technology) and Hopefully we can help you save your time and efforts.

      It's for you to decide which is best for you we are only here trying to give you our experience so it's also up to you to accept it or not. We've made a Spotify like as a single page app and our stack was much much simpler than what you are talking about.

      that your application writes files on the local disk and you wanted to move
      the files to a shared directory, writing fixed path in your code will make the
      application not scalable. So this has to be in mind during design time.\n\nFor
      the availability, assume that your application uses urls for links instead of
      uri, that will simply brake the application availability.\n\nI just want to
      say that you have to keep these stuff in your mind while designing your stack
      by those two simple example. \n\nWhile I mentioned why is Java is the best fit
      for me; you didn't mention why you don't recommend it.\n\nLet's return to the

      Sorry I Also didn't get what do you mean by "assume that your application uses urls for links instead of uri, that will simply brake the application availability."

      Explain these 2 points and I will tell why Java will not be the best option for your App ;)

      doesn't have to do anything here. Normally any good enough hosting provider
      send you alarms when you are running out of memory or desk space so you can
      login to your account and upgrade your memory and your disk space.\n\n- URLs
      vs URIs is a very easy solvable problem, If you have a a router in your application
      that manage your urls you can tell your router when the user gets /testFunction
      do whatever action you want to do such as load the home page with and load a
      specific partial of contents according to your needs!\n\nNow As Promised Why
      java is not the best option. You Thought of the Technology before thinking what

      Nop, Who said you need to configure a a router for every single url! Let's assume you are trying to make a dropbox ok?

      So you would make a router that process all the urls that has /files/ in the url and this will dispatch an event to your javascript asking for a file that has the url /files/how-to-make-awesome-apps.pdf which you ask for the file availability using your rest API and if the file exist you serve it if not you trigger a 404 handler.

      Have you investigated other technologies that is not Java ? Have you checked Node.JS or even ExpressJS for server side? the learning curve is very slow and the Restful APIs can take up to 2 weeks to be done using 1 Person depending on your needs.
