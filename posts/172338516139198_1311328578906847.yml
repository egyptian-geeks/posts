  Hi Gks,
  In Angular2, Is there anyway for dealing with forms rather than form tag??? As In Angular1, there was <form> and <ng-form>. Is there something like that in Angular2 or we must deal with form tag?!

      In angular 2, there are two types of forms ,,, template based forms , ,that's the way we are used to with forms ,, depends on the form tag, name attribute etc ,,
      and the other one is Model driven forms ,, that depends on FormGroup
      please check this : http://blog.angular-university.io/introduction-to-angular-2-forms-template-driven-vs-model-driven/

      It's possible, with a gotcha...

      # Template Forms

      If you look for the selector for ngForm directive in Angular2, you'll find it like that:
      form:not([ngNoForm]):not([formGroup])
      ngForm
      [ngForm]

      Note that last one. Any element with ngForm attribute should work.

      Reference: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/NgForm-directive.html

      # Reactive Forms

      The selector for formGroup directive is:
      [formGroup]

      Which also means that any element with formGroup attribute should work.

      Reference:
      https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/FormGroupDirective-directive.html

      # Note

      There is a critical bug with non-form elements used as forms in Angular 2. The submit events do not work. The implementation is just not as mature as Angular 1.

      I have raised a bug here in March, but it's probably a low priority:
      https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7807
      You might be able to comment on it stating your scenario to bring it some attention.

    message: Thanks Mohamed for your help. I can do it with selector [formGroup],
      using it on nay tag will deal with it as ReactiveModuleForm, even it's not <form>
      . and that's what I need :D .. but [ngForm] doesn't work, I think it's deprecated
      in rcy6 ..
