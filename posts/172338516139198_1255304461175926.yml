message: For the pythonistas here, have you used either Enaml or Kivy before? Would
  you recommend either, or something different, for UI development?

    message: I experimented with Kivy and I liked it, haven't done major UI priject
      but I was impressed that the UI worked on Linux, Android and Windows at the
      same time by simply importing a Python module.

    message: "Here is what I found so far, leaving it here in case it may be of use
      for someone else later:\n\nKivy is nice and simple, especially for mobile apps.
      It supports \"natural\" UI interactions out-of-the-box. It has its own set of
      widgets, and a reasonably active community. However, theming/styling does not
      seem to be straightforward, and it does not have a native look. The latter is
      a big drawback for me, since I really do want to use it for desktop development
      and don't care much about cross-platform portability at this point (which is
      one of the biggest selling points for Kivy, as Muhammad pointed out also) \n\nEnaml
      is a declarative extension to python for defining UIs (as the author puts it).
      The cool thing is that you specify the UI framework that you want Enaml to use.
      So you can use Enaml on top of Qt and have a nice native-looking UI with simple/elegant
      code. My main issue with it is the lack of active development. It seems to be
      pretty mature, but development stagnated about 1 year ago."
