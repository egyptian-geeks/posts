  I created an open-source app called "Cairo: Streets & Stories"[1], shared by Khaled M. Diab & originally suggested by the journalist Ismail Al Eskandarani. The idea is to convert the book of the same name[2] to an interactive map with rich info & images. It allows end-users to enter the data.

  Because of the nature of the app & that Egyptians rarely do crowd-sourcing, my budget for hosting the initial version is zero. Also I will put ads in there, so if the site gets a lot of traffic, it can cover its own hosting  money.

  Let's dive in technicality: In the beginning I thought that I would make it a static website hosted on gh-pages & use GitHub for editing geojson, but GitHub uses maps for viewing only, not editing. Also, GitHub is not Egyptian-end-users-friendly.

  Now I have to make a dynamic part, so there are the options in my head now

  1. Use gh-pages for the front-end & a small back-end to edit geojson & upload images to github. I'm still thinking of the best way to do authentication.

  2. Make a dynamic app on AppEngine. I get a free instance, but I will be locked.

  3. Make a dynamic app on Heroku (or a similar thing?). I want a free instance with DB storage.

  4. What is the best option to store images? Flickr gives 1TB free, but I'm open to suggestions
