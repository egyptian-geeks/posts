    message: It depends on your users. Geography makes this kind of statistics less
      important (but not totally unimportant). For a large banking app that started
      2 years ago, we managed to fire IE6 away by getting statistics of "the main
      bank website" suggesting that IE6 trend was dropping near 1%, which was the
      accepted threshold for excluding support.

    message: 'In other enterprises, the users are forced to use certain version of
      IE for other apps that only work on these and/or other reasons that are beyond
      your control. The point is: always get to know which users you expect, and worry
      about THEIR usage statistics rather than global ones. Like everything engineering,
      measure "your" conditions.'

    message: Another horror story in that regard, another bank (out of the 4 biggest
      banks of Australia), gives their employees Macbook Air laptops. Imagine that,
      wow! However, they get Windows XP installed on them!! How crazy! And for certain
      group policy issues (that work in Chrome mostly well, but had a bug soon to
      be fixed), they decided to keep IE as main platform, not Chrome or Chrome frame
      (which is dying anyway).
