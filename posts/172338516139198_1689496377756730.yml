      Read the legal documents (or their current draft) properly, to determine which classes of goods and services are taxable and adjust your system accordingly, if you are using an ERP/accounting system to handle the company's financial stuff, you can ask the system's consultants to help you implement the new changes.

      In Egypt vat was applied after replacing the sales tax.
      General changes:
      Sales tax:
      Generally all products were 10% taxable with some exceptions on table or predefined tariffs for specific products.
      Services were exempted by default except the mentioned in tables. (ضريبة جدول )

      VAT:
      After vat the general percentage increased from 10% to 13% in 2016 and then to be 14% from July 1st 2017..
      Services are now taxable by default except otherwise mentioned in  tables (the opposite of sales tax)

      That's example of what happened in Egypt, so in UAE you should adhere to the regulations there which will differ from Egypt.

      Often legal/tax consultation agencies provide training offers for companies to train their employees on the new changes.

    message: Call them and ask. In Egypt  You should register for vat even if your
      business doesn't require it upfront like you said, a commission based revenue.
      So you might end up paying the same regular taxes
