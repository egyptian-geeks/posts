    message: Yeah I use it all the time. Sometimes you see JSfiddle exmaples broken
      in Chrome because they were written before a restriction was added to the browser
      requiring script files to have a JavaScript mime type, while the fiddle had
      direct references to github repo raw URL, which returns a plain text mime type.
      Replacing them with a RawGithub URL (just copying and removing a dot) gets them
      to work again.

    message: I prefer to use GH pages. It has the added benefit of working on the
      default branch freely, while considering the gh-pages as the stable branch

      This is useful for very quick / experimental prototyping fiddle-style stuff, when you want to use files created by others to test something.

      I remember there is a disclaimer / warning there about not relying on it for anything serious.

  - description: You've got a raw.github.com URL that points to some work-in-progress
      HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. You'd like to share it with someone for a quick demo,
      or maybe you'd like to use it in a jsPerf test.
