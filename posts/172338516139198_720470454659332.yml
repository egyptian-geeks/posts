    message: "Way greater? That's a stretch.\n\nThe number of developers that do Javascript
      in what sense in comparison to C? \nJavascript is first and foremost a scripting
      language not a full-featured programming language. The reason it's gaining traction
      is the node.js environment and toolchain.\n\nThe number of node.js developers
      as compared to C is far lower than what one would normally anticipate in a knee-jerk
      assumption.\n\nYou have thousands upon thousands of packages for every flavour
      that has ever existed and is still maintained of *nix systems. Most of which
      are either in C or C++\n\nYou have the hundreds of developers contributing daily
      to the maintenance of these *nix systems. Not to mention the grand majority
      of most language implementations including node.js and most of your favourite
      browsers are all either in C, C++ or both. And the thousands of contributing
      developers + their core teams.\n\nGame engines, toolchains, mission-critical
      commercial quality software deployments from space programs to missile guidance
      systems. Most of weapon grade code development deployed in some of the most
      sophisticated war machinery out there. From helicopters to tanks.\n\nCars, factory
      automation systems, satellites, receivers and broad casting technologies. Most
      of the embedded technologies.\n\nIt's all either C, C++ or something built on-top
      or in C or C++. I think it's a fair bet to say C-family engineers out number
      any other technology out there.\n\nNow if we are talking about Javascript as
      a client-side scripting language, then that's a whole different story.\n\nEdit:
      Javascript as a community has potential. If its community ever turns into more
      backend engineers than frontend engineers. The knowledge set of a backend engineer
      differs greatly than that of a frontend engineer."

    message: Ahmed El-Jabry some crazy developers just like to mix stuff keda, .Net
      on Android, .Net on a Microprocessor (netduino), Windows on ARM, (Macromedia!)
      Flash for Airline Schedule Screens (Egy Airlines! lol!), Prolog for ... anything
      really, Erlang for a 3D Modelling Program (Wings3D), Java for 3D Games that
      consume gigs of memory (Minecraft), Shakespeare and programming, all these are
      crazy, magatsh 3ala JavaScript on Embedded Systems :D

    message: Hady Ahmed i liked you previous conversation bgad, fair enough you've
      convinced me. that's right about what you said about nodejs. actually this community
      is getting viral in no time. even the js community as a whole is getting even
      more and more. but i've no idea which of the two communities (C or js) is gaining
      more support(but i think at this point js wins). also the number of node packages
      is getting bigger in no time too which i don't think i happens in C or C++ communities.
      BTW i believe that C is way better and more reliable that js. js is a very weak
      language. BTW im a backend engineer :D

      Alaa I agree :D

      Hassan in all fairness, I like the the spaghetti. Erlang though, we've moved most of our infrastructure in Tabshora to Erlang since April 2013, wing3D was a real stretch :D can't say it was a bad decision though. There's a lot more to it than most people think.

      Ahmed I wouldn't jump too soon to that conclusion.

      Hady Ahmed I like that spaghetti too, specially ones with "Mono" in them, MonoRail? MonoTorrent? Mono on Raspberry Pi? MonoGame? Port Android to Mono?
      I find all these stuff interesting :)
      fun fact: that last one actually led to a performance improvement :D
