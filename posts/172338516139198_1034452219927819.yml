  A classic quote worth remembering.
  On that note, there's a good book on the topic called "Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual" by John Sonmez. Recommended.
  He also has a free youtube channel called SimpleProgrammer that has a lot of videos on career and soft skill topics.

  There is one important point to make clear though. These numbers do NOT`mean you should have %15 technical skills and 85% soft skills.

  This totally depends on your role. Each role is different. this ratio might work for entrepreneur, they definitely won't work for a senior developer.

  The numbers don't represent the investment you need to put, but the effect.

  If I want to move from developer to senior developer, learning to know how to deliver feedback to other developers, how to communicate technical problems to business people, can make WAY more valuable senior developer.

  And "likely" a higher paid one (because you deliver more value, and you know how to present it).

  Of course there are exceptions, but I don't think it's smart to optimize your life for trying to be the one who succeeded while failing at leadership skills, or communication with other people.

  If you want to be exceptional, be the one that combines both. Those are quite rare in fact :)

      Well, actually this statement is not 100% accurate for one reason. It would make sense only in case that your technical knowledge is the same or in the same level as everyone else, in that case, your interpersonal skills are what differentiate you from the norm.

      That fact changes dramatically when your technical skills are making you the "expert" in your area of work. For example, I met several people in my career (in Microsoft for example) who are considered to be the textbook definition for the word "asshole" and yet they hold a very high level and they are very valuable because they have rare or exceptional technical knowledge.

      Generally, once you cross a certain level of knowledge, people really don't give a damn about your personal skills because they can get you several assistants who could take care of that.

      One very famous example for what I said above was Steve Jobs. I worked in a startup that he was an adviser for and I got semi-personal communications with him. You can scratch that part about personality, communication and that crap cause he really didn't give a fuck about any of it and yet, he was considered a world icon
