  Hello Geeks,
  Did anyone "recently" switch from Linux to macOS? what did you miss? what is your experience? how do you feel now? :D
  I am using Linux since 2007 so it will be a big move for me and I'm sure it will be hard and I will take time to adapt.

      a lot then you will miss the package manager only, but brew will help .. otherwise

      a system builder you will definitely miss throwing some random hardware together
      and it will just work, for example you will pretty much say good bye to Nvidia
      hardware, no matter how much money you're willing to spend you can't get it
      built in a Mac machine."

      I miss the productivity
      The keybindings and the wms
      Mac is unix based so for devs everyday use differences are really unnoticeable but for a power user, window tiling and keybindings Linux wins
      Maybe my answer is biased bs I have both Mac and Linux at work on a daily basis
