  Greetings...

  I'm using XAMPP package to simulate server-side codes in my localhost and I got a strange problem. Whenever I submit data using GET, they show up on the URL while I can't display the received data through "echo" function in PHP after checking that the data were set and they are not empty.

  I searched this problem in Google but It seems that I was not able to express it using the right words and the well-known troubles regarding form submission are not applicable to my case.

  Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated =)

      Well, when I removed this function:
      - mysql_real_escape_string();

      it worked well, but I need to validate the data I received from server-side. Any ideas why mysql_real_escape_string() caused this error ?! :)

    message: For the sake of simplicity you can use strip_slashes and strip_tags in
      addition to htmlentities "it is better to replace it with htmlspecialchars",
      mysql_blabla() functions are deprecated furthermore you should connect to the
      mysql server before using this function "as i remember"

    message: Mustafa Hammad I have a question for you, why don't you use one of the
      many PHP frameworks instead of using raw php? is it a product you are building
      wla you are exercising?

      Would you believe me if I told you that I like using raw PHP over PHP frameworks ?! .. but that could change in the near future .. who knows. I was not really exercising, I was building something and this issue came across .. Thanks :)

      Yeah .. this guy solved it for me (Mohamed El Shaer) and I confirmed what he said from www.php.net manual of using mysql_real_escape_string() =)

      as you said, this function won't work unless MySQL connection was opened and here is the result. Thank you for extending on what El Shaer said earlier Mahmoud Tantawy =)
