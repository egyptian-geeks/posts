message: "Remember Nick Craver I mentioned earlier? The developer and SysAdmin at
  StackOverflow? He's just published a blog post about the entire infrastructure behind
  StackOverflow the 2016 edition.\nHe mentioned earlier and I'm quoting him \"One
  of the reasons I love working at Stack Overflow is weâ€™re encouraged to talk about
  almost anything out in the open. Except for things companies always keep private
  like financials and the nuclear launch codes, everything else is fair game.\". Usually
  he posts on Twitter screenshot from their database monitoring server containing
  table names, row counts and sizes. This approach is very nice. Also the fact that
  StackOverflow is served from only 11 webservers is awesome!\nFollow this guy and
  his blog. This post is a first in a series. \nhttps://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/"
