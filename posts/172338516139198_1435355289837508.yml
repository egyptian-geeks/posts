    message: it is very good to know that we do have the skills. I understand your
      point but in my opinion the world is changing dramatically.  the opportunity
      is huge in middle east and Africa. nowadays it goes the other way around ,people
      do not know what they need basically you have to guide them through. in my opinion
      it is the time now for riding the tide. for example Xalted from India http://www.xaltedcorp.com/
      just sold to Dubai Policy a crime detection solution for about 500k USD (not
      including support and operation). if we have the skills I would be very interested
      to get in touch with people who would like to take the initiatives and see how
      we can build something.
