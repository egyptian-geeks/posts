  I want to understand progressive web / mobile apps.

  If I am gonna build normal web application (front end in angular) and native ios and android mobile apps.

  Do I replace this, and build progressive web and mobile apps instead ?

  Or do I build both native and progressive ?

  Or if I build native, then no need for progressive ?

  Also, are progressive apps developed in a specific framework/language ?

  افيدونا يرحمني و يرحمكم الله

      The decision for choosing Native or PWA is based on your situation for example, if you're creating a social media application like facebook and you want to have a platform specific user experience, an amazing UI feature, Native performance and you have budget for that then Native is your choice.
      If you want to create a Data Driven application that shares huge amount of code between all platforms and you want to reduce the cost and you care less about UI (doesn't mean you want ugly UI but UI is not your main target) then PWA is your target.

      To choose put into consideration, Budget, User Experience and Code maintainability

    message: "Any webapp can be (pwa), its a matter of implementing serverworkers,
      offline cacheing, manifest etc.. So you dont need a specific framework; its
      vanilla js in all cases.\nWhy do we need it ? \nA: its a matter of quality,
      it doesnt replace native apps, it just make ur webapp better available for user's;
      also understand that 99% of ur users wond bookmark ur webapp, but still will
      benefint from speed and loading time u provide which will reflect back on ux.\nDo
      you need nativeapp ?\nYes and no.. If you have tons of animations, pwa will
      fail u; performance wonnt be good. Also if you need access hardware the pwa
      run inside browser so you gona be limited. If not then use ur pwa ina cordova
      is a good choice."
