      I think this guy never heard of something called "Strongloop" which is based on node bought by IBM lately.

      He may change his mind forever!

      Not at all .. Did you use it on an Enterprise product?

      I am using it on 2 products right now.

      great, but here is my experience, we started with Express and then found Loopback and decided to go with loopback, fantastic API explorer , models and as you told it's bought by IBM
      but then I found my self searching a lot for the basics like ACLs, i apply the documentation exactly it doesn't work, I search and find no reply, as no one is using it.
      I usually care about the product not the technique used, I started to compare between Laravel and NodeJS, I couldn't find any reasonable results encourage me to go with NodeJS, decided to go with Laravel, I'm satisfied 100% about this decision.
