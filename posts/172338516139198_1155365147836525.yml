  anyone worked on face detection problem before ?

  I'm trying to search for a diverse dataset that contains different faces sizes, illumination diversity .. etc (i've found some of them already), but all what I've found up-till now are easy datasets (faces are almost the same size and the same pose).

  also i'm searching for hard negative examples (pictures that look like faces but aren't actually faces) to make sure that the detector is robust, or retrain if necessary.

  Thank you

      One hack is to analyse false positives to have an idea of what images you need
      to add in your training.

    message: Use TinEye's API and just pull whatever images you'd like. Thus, you
      create your own corpus rather than trying to use someone else's one ;)
