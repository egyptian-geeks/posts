      I wrote several complains to PayPal and they mentioned that the CBE forbid transfers from PayPal to your accounts in USD. It must be in EGP. And it's only added to your credit cards not your debit cards. If you attemp to withdraw it in cash you will be charged with a percentage even if your credit is covering your credit limit.
      HSBC solve that by calling the customer support asking them to make transfer from your credit card to your bank account or to your debit card to withdraw the money cause it cannot be done from the internet banking

    message: I confirm Ahmed Melege's answer. I personally called them for the same
      purpose and that's what they said. However, you can call PayPal support and
      ask, and they're just amazing and very responsive.
