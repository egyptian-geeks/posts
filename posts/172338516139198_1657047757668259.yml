message: "I've a question regarding blockchain technologies & ICOs\n\nSo far most
  ICOs I came across are offering blockchain tech for very limited industries like
  fintech, cyber security/identity management or even solving the inefficiencies of
  the blockchain networks themselves\n\nMy questions is: can blockchain networks  be
  adopted in tech startups for other typical industries? \n\nFor example can a marketplace
  startup in the healthcare industry utilise blockchain and hence be able to consider
  ICO as a potential source for funds?"

    message: ICOs can be created to fund anything, not necessarily blockchain projects.
      But the problem is in connecting the project to the token you're selling so
      that your investors would benefit from your success.
