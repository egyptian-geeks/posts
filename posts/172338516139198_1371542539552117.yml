      If you have an edu email you can get Clion for free.
      Very stable on linux.

      There's no crash for no reason, check what the stacktrace says and maybe open a ticket with the developers if it hasn't been reported yet.

      But I would suggest getting accustomed to the command line anyway, it's not that hard.

    message: If you want to switch and insist on an IDE there are other good choices
      like eclipse, kdevelop and clion (but you'll have to be familiar with cmake
      for clion)

    message: you can try netbeans , its not as light as code blocks but it will do
      the job, or u can just get a good editor and compile & run using ur terminal
      which is not a bad idea

      Crashes on Linux,  and crashes even more on MacOs.
      Try CLion, It's beautiful!

      Please report an issue on their tracker with the complete scenario.

      Side note: when I do c/c++ I use codelite
