  Now I'm more sure than before that C# is mimicking Java :D

      When C# 1 was launched, a lot of Java programmers said that C# is a copy of Java, ignoring that C# has fixed some of the things in Java (added operator overloading, no checked exceptions). C# 2 added generics while Java was still discussing it. C# 3 added more functional programming features, C# 4 is mixed static/dynamic. C# 5 added async.

      It's not a mistake to mimic somebody else if he is doing the right thing. I worked with Java for sometime & I really want this platform to move forward. I'm just making fun of the attitude itself.

  - description: In a previous post, I talked about new features and performance of
      java 1.7. Java 7 has now been released a while ago and Java 8 is coming. Java
      1.8 is planned to be released on the 9th of September 2013. I'm going to present
      the main new features of the Java 8 (JDK8). I will show some code examples...
