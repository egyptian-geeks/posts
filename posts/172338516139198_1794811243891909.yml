  which phone carrier got the best 4G coverage?
  wanna buy a MiFi but on the fence between Vodafone & TE? also is there a significant difference in hardware specs between the MiFi devices that carriers sell?

    message: I don't think TE offer 4G for now. Anyway in my opinion, Vodafone is
      the best in coverage
