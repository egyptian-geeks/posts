message: "I had doubts about the accuracy of the TeamViewer hack news that spread
  out this week, it had no real reliable source beside the company denied it and the
  fact it was timed with major passwords breach all play in favor of the doubt \n\nUsually
  when a company get breached and user accounts stolen what the hackers do is offering
  to sell the accounts in black market which we did not see in this case \n\nNothing
  can be certain and because of how critical to security running a compromised TeamViewer
  service could be people have every right to panic, i myself stopped the TeamViewer
  service on any critical machine i had ( better safe than sorry ) but as it been
  couple of days now with no further updates i wonder if it would be safe to use the
  service again now \n\n"
