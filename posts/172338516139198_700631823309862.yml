      Ahmad Abd-Elghany it's uncalled for, minimalism is often mistaken for simplicity but that's almost identical to false humility.
      A simple solution is nice but a complex solution is on the contrary to common belief, often faster, more stable and highly efficient. The question becomes, do you expose that complexity or not?
      A concept like KISS is not about keeping everything simple at core, it's about keeping everything simple at the top layers. Where the user is bound to interact with a system 8 hours a day like clockwork.

      The problem a lot of people face is when to use what and why. If I see this on basecamp, rest assured I'm cancelling my account two minutes after.
      If I see this on my girlfriend's contact us form, I'll think that shit is cute and bookmark the page.
      You have to ask yourself, is it necessary? Does it help the experience? Well, if it doesn't help, does it break the experience? For a bank entry form, yes. For a pap's and mom's website, no.
