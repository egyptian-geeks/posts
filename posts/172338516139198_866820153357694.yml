  http://phpshield.com

  http://www.ioncube.com/php_encoder.php

  we are about moving the source code of a big project to a new server and we do not trust the new host yet ... so we will encode it as precaution

      Worrying that the host would steal your source code is not a normal thing at all. This leads me to the following possibilities:

      - Either there are good reasons to not trust this host, in this case, you really want to avoid using them rather than secure the code

      - Or the code is really that special that really have to hide it. Pro tip: %99.9999 it isn't, unless you work in some very obscure scientific field with real secrets, but then also very few people would value it not including the host, so, it still isn't!

      - Or the person triggering this worry to your team is just a freak. I might bet on this one if it's not the first.

      Just a side note: the correct name is "code obfuscation", not "encoding"

      Back to the main topic: just as everyone said, if you don't trust the host, do use them

      Mohammad Tayseer obfuscation is another thing that allows to rename variables and functions names to a named that is not understandable  , but encoding is transforming it to an encoded form looks like  :

      Mohammad Tayseer, the php community is a bit retarded on this naming, but the tools they use call this encoding, although I don't believe it is encoding, it is either obfuscation or encrypting.

      Anyway, back to Arabs Knight's question, don't do it!

      Performance will suffer, and above all if you don't trust your host then don't move to it in the first place!

      The typical use-case of "encoding" is distributing a php project to a large mass of people with a license that prohibits modifications or redistribution and  trying to enforce that license.

      In this case I would rather distribute the project as a compiled php extension instead.
