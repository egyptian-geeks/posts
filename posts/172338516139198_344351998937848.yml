    message: I am familiar with godaddy, I think the difference in prices not so big,
      The only think that i can't get the "Unlimited Space" I think they have rols
      to keep space, I may try hostgator someday

    message: Dude, Godaddy sucks! they don't even have live support! i have been with
      hostgator since 2006 till now and it's amazing! their support is always online
      and they reallly help. With godaddy i had a client who has his hosting with
      Godaddy, a problem happened with the email and i contacted their support guess
      after how much time they answered?! it took them 6 MONTHS to reply my fucking
      email :@ so i recommend HostGator for sure :)
