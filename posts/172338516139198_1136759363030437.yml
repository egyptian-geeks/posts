    message: "Current approaches in video streaming is based on adaptive streaming
      over HTTP, where the server stores multiple copies of the original video in
      different formats and qualities (bitrates). Each copy is divided into segments
      of equal length. The client is smart and chooses the qualities of each segment
      during the streaming session based on different objectives. \n\nThe major vendor-free
      standardization effort is DASH. It simply defines a file (it defines many things
      as well) called media presentation descriptor (MPD) that lists the available
      segments and their qualities. The file in addition to the video copies are stored
      in HTTP server. The client fetches this file at the beginning and decides during
      the streaming session what quality to fetch. \n\nThere are many JS clients that
      adopt DASH:\n- dash.js (DASH-IF): the reference client implementation from DASH
      industry forum\n- video.js: if you use videojs, you should use this plugin with
      it (https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-dash)\n- shaka player (google):
      https://github.com/google/shaka-player\n\nYou'll notice that all these libraries
      request an MPD file, not a video. In your case, your task is to:\n- encode the
      original video into multiple copies with different qualities (SD, HD, etc...)\n-
      segment each copy\n- generate the MPD file that lists the segments locations
      and their qualities\n- use one of the previous libraries with the URL of generated
      MPD.\n\nYou can use ffmpeg for encoding, and Bento (https://www.bento4.com/developers/dash/)
      for segmenting videos and generating the MPD."

    message: DASH technology is what you seek about , you have to use Media server
      that support mult bitrates LIKE WOWZA you may apply some ffmpeg in your server
      side , and also you need player support DASH
