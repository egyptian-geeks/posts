      Lately I'm interested in making side projects, and encouraging people to make their own side projects. It's enjoying, and useful both on the personal level & the community level.

      It just happens that most of my applications use maps. Maps can be used to represent a lot of data in a very convenient way, e.g. you can see the traffic congestion in Cairo in one look (Taree2y & Wasalny), know where most crimes happen (Zabatak), like harassments (http://harassmap.org/), measure the number of people who can fit in a geographic area (howmanypeoplefithere.rawa7.com), measure taxi cost for a given distance (http://mtayseer.github.io/my-taxi-ride/), transit analysis (rawa7.com), nearest restaurants (yelp.com).

      In the past few week I've been researching how to use maps effectively, e.g. if you want to create a project which employs a map, how I can create it in the fastest way possible. A lot of my shared links in the past weeks are about this.

      BTW if you have learning materials about GIS in general, please share them. I know the basics only.

      PS: This comment is becoming its own blog post :)

    message: Mohammad Tayseer You developed all of these apps using Python? Are you
      working with .NET in Main projects/job and python in side projects?

    message: "I use Python for most of my side projects. Eidetic, Rawa7 & \"How many
      people fit here\" uses Python. \"My Taxi Ride\" is just JS - no server side.
      \n\nI used Python before in a production app & it served us well, but the client
      objected & asked for it to be re-implemented using .net. My current position
      is the 1st one where I can use Python full time.\n\nBTW not all the websites
      mentioned in my previous comments are mine :)"
