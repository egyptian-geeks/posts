    message: Mohamed Samy Github pages gives you a github subdomain ( something.github.io
      ) and you can even link it to your custom domain, allows javascript and CSS
      styling, You can use something like disqus.com for having comments on your blog.
      Basically github pages gives you a static website host for free.

    message: Nothing is wrong with just writing in the Wiki, but it's bad. You don't
      have full control on styling, you can't link it with your domain ( other than
      redirection ). If you want to link to your blog, the link would be ( github.com/username/repo/wiki
      ) which is awful. Github pages is the best place for what you are trying to
      do.

    message: Muhammad Bassem if you read my actual post, I don't want anythng fancy
      , and comments can just be added on the wiki or on the file like with code.
      I also like simplitic text. I am even using EMACS because I have this thing
      now for text editors. Muhammad Bassem I will try it out but seems like added
      complexity. WIll get back to you with what I will do :)

    message: "Btw on github pages your content will still be version controlled. It's
      still in a public repo and u can still use emacs :D And concerning the complexity
      and simplicity, there are many ready to use templates in which you just write
      the post in markdown and it will handle the styling for you. I use one for my
      own blog, to give you an example :\nhere's a post from my blog's repo :\nhttps://github.com/MohamedBassem/MyBlog/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2015-02-04-my-journey-with-trustious.md\nand
      that's what I wrote using vim : \nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohamedBassem/MyBlog/gh-pages/_posts/2015-02-04-my-journey-with-trustious.md\nand
      here's how it got rendered on github pages :\nhttp://blog.mbassem.com/2015/02/04/my-journey-with-trustious/\nYou
      can notice the difference :D"

    message: yeah Big difference, the idea is to use as much plain text as possible
      for me. You know when you open Notepad and just type text? No fonts not bull
      droppings :) But of course the pne on github pages is much smoother :)

    message: I got what you mean. That's the basic markdown formatting. But how did
      you get the link of this article ? Do you think that's a good url for a blog
      ? If you are - for example - talking about some javascript example, would you
      be able to embed a demo in the gist ?  Too many limitations that you can avoid
      with a 5 mins setup and then doing the exact same effort that you'll do in the
      wiki. But with those 5 mins you will give your readers a better experience.
      That's my opinion :D

      I'm also hosting my blog on Github pages http://themsaid.github.io/

      Matt Stauffer also created https://gistlog.co/ it has the same idea you are talking about, however I see it better to have your github pages blog, better customisation and better linking.

      BTW, you can use any of these static site generators https://www.staticgen.com/ and host them on Github or even Heroku.

      I migrated my website from WordPress and paid hosting to use HarpJS & hosted it on Herkou. https://github.com/ahmedelgabri/gabri.me
