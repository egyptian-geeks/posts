  Can someone teach us step by step how to join open source project teams? I tried freecodecamp but couldn't get to point where i can join a team, or a specific project and be assigned tasks or join team planning meetings! So i got lost.
  Im already expert web dev. , what i seek is to fortify my resume with proof through community contrib.  :)

    message: A good way to start contributing as a tester of the beta versions of
      the project, so get familiar with the project and its code, the u pic small
      issues and so on. Also u can start by contributing in writing the documentation.

      Pick a project you are familiar with / using a lot / passionate about

      Read its full documentation and how to contribute guide

      Join its forum / IRC / slack / dev group

      Download the code and skim it to understand its high level structure and architecture

      Check the bug list at its issue tracking tool

      Pick a bug and fix it following their coding standards

      Sumbit a patch / pull request and speak up

      Once your fixes get accepted and you gain respect by the community, check feature requests and new stories. ..

      Finally you can now submit your own new feature suggestions as well

    message: "I think Github is your way to start, check the open issues tab.\n- Fork
      the repo first, try solve the issue, reply with your solution within the issue
      thread linking to your fork.\n- connect with the project contributors to understand
      if they can merge a pull request including your issue resolve. \n- subscribe
      to notifications for the issues you see you can resolve.\n- upon getting recognition
      from your continuous contribution, you will definitely be invited to the team
      talks, slack, telegram etc."
