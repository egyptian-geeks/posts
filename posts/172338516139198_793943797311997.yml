      Sorry i got confused !
      did you mean the systeminfo command on windows ?
      do you want to query devices remotely about their vendors ?
      or you want to send this information to a remote computer from your local machine ?

      The last two questions seem to be identical for me as i don't know too much in this area , but whether a remote device access targeted machine and take this info without any interface from user or my local host send this info to the one that i need to achieve this information  .
      Is this possible ?

      You will probably need to make them run some exe / active x. You can't do it from web, for good reasons.
      Take dell as an example, it uses an active x. Some other way may be ClickOnce application the user installs (if the command can be run from console that is not run as administrator)

    message: When you go to DELL support and tell it to detect your machine, it installs
      an active X that communicates to the page and then it knows the service tags
      and takes you to the support page for your machine.
