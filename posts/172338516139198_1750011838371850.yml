message: "Hey everyone\ni'm wondering if technology can apply Psychology in a more
  smart way than usual through a smart chatbot Agent.\ni'm building a chatbot using\n(
  Google API AI , Firebase , Text-to-speech )\nbut i know there is a lot is missing
  .\n\nPsychology is a deep field to dive into but the real question is \ncan we apply
  Psychology in a smart Psychologist chatbot Agent ? and if it could how can we do
  it? and is it a good idea or Psychotherapy needs a Psychologist who have to be a
  human being only?"
