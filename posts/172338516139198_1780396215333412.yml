  Hello,

  Have anyone tried reading a file from the server by chunks? using javascript?
  I know the API does support reading by chunks (actually it opens a file stream) but I don't have a clue what request shall I do with javascript to call it, is it a normal HTTP one?
  I've done some search and I found this
  https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
  It supports reading file by bytes but still not sure if this is what I'm looking for.
  I need to read the file on scrolling.

  Thank you,
