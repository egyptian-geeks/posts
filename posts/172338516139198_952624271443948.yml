    message: 'Added this recently. I''m monitoring to see if it makes a significant
      difference. I''m terrible at controlling my tabs. Sometimes I have 50+ open

      useful: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/context/aalnjolghjkkogicompabhhbbkljnlka?hl=en
      It allows you to group extensions (e.g., standard, webdev, tools, etc) and activate
      incrementally in any combination. Works well when you''re set up. Extensions
      not in use suck RAM and add to the footprint of Chrome'

      Now, allow me to hijack this thread. I have seen do many popular tech sites talk about this extension at the same time (around 3 weeks ago).

      From experience, this kind of timing is never random, and often is the result of agreements with the editors (paid or not).

      Anyone close enough or found a podcast or whatever that they have the insider story of how this was arranged by the extension creator?

      Allow me to hijack this thread too 3:)..
      Can I find any convenience reason for this ? .. when I open facebook tab about ((60%)) of my "I5-3230M quad core 2.6GHz " resources is being used :( !
      I tried disabling all Extensions .. closing all other tabs .. but nothing better happens ... yet when I switch to any other tab .. it's ok .. no more than 1% is used then ...

    message: One thing that really helps is to set plugins tho run only on click.
      This saves you from all the evil Flash in the pages you visit, until you want
      to watch singing and then you just click it to work. Makes a big difference.

    message: You probably need that extension if you are the kind of person who have
      tens of useless poorly coded extensions and you open a lot of tabs ... If you
      keep things simple, use extensions efficiently, keep the opened tabs close to
      what you really need then you will never have problems with memory management
      in Chrome :)

      Osama, I think Ahmad's comment wad not about your issue but the post itself.

      Ahmed, easier said than done to some people. Not all usage patterns are the same. Different people optimize certain areas and leave other based on their own style/priorities

      I check the memory/cpu usage per extension from Chrome's tasks manager. If an extension is using high resources, I just remove it.
      If I really need that extension then I disable it till I need it.
      Most of the time you don't need 75% of the extensions you are using ...
      example -> that extension that tells you what are the technologies a particular website is built with on the address bar. You don't need to know that 90% of the time.
      example -> Additional DevTools debuggin extensions for JavaScript frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Angular ... etc. You don't need it till you are debudding something.
      Also, DevTools takes a lot of resources. Don't leave it open in a tab without using them. Close it and open it when you need it.
      Chrome might be far from optimized when it comes to resources, you have to overcome it with some techniques. Of move to something else like Firefox like what Amr Eldib was saying :)
      For me, Chrome DevTools are indispensable
