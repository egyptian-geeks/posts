message: "Hi geeks, now I have a problem.\nI am thinking of taking three months vacation
  & study android development & make a career shift to mobile development. That thought
  came because of the increasing demand on mobile devs for all companies & also the
  market share is moving towards them in the feature.\n\nCurrently i am a fullstack
  dev, i can handle myself as both. But iam not that good in any of them. \nI dont
  like backend that much. But iam good at it. \nFront end world is very hard to keep
  up with & every company is using a totally different stack of tools for it. \nSo
  no matter how experienced i am, every company i join i will be the noob in the team.\n&
  also i dont have the same time i used to have for studing anymore. \n\nMy questions
  are.\nWhat's ur opinion on the subject ?\nWill 3 months be enough to study android
  dev fully or i need more time ?\nDid i miss anything in my question ?"

      I don't think 3 months are enough, but you say you have some experience with it already. So, how far did you go? Check the community, via twitter or reddit/r/androiddev and see how relevant and current your experience is.
      It can be a bit overwhelming, and personally, I'm not sure that dropping what you have and dedicating only 3 months to this is the best way forward.

    message: I had three months studying and started working as an android dev normally..  I
      was 2 years experience web developer too.. A point of warning though.. If i
      had stayed as a web dev i would have been a senior now or something..  But as
      a new Android dev you'll likely be treated as a junior ..  You'll feel a little
      bit behind.. If you're okay with this go for it

      as a backend developer who do some frontend * using react *, I advise you not to do that,
       Better be perfect in one thing than average in all of things,However.. you could take it as steps towards being a solution developer *ie perfect at everything *.
       First be very good in backend, then frontend * or both at the time *, then shift to another development area at that point you're already familiar with the  ins and out of both backend and frontend and you find yourself repeating what you do over and over ,and if there is any new tool or tech out there you can learn it in max 2 weeks!.
       and you have time to study whatever else you want, be it mobile, security or even game development .

      Disclaimer: This is my personal experience and few notes or maybe learnings that might be helpful to you as you make your decision.

      Some background, I had 8+ years of experience in very low level, backend and distributed systems (Windows file systems, O365 and then Amazon AWS - EC2).
      I joined Facebook three years ago and made one of the toughest choices in my career by switching to Android development (you get to choose which team you want to join at FB, so it was my choice).

      Like you mentioned, this meant to me at the time that I was throwing away a lot of years of my experience while I was joining one of the most competitive companies and working with some of the best engineers in the industry. I was supposed to be a senior/technical lead on a new team working on a technology that I have zero years of experience in.

      I had one week of FB's "Android training", and few initial Android tasks to work on, then I was thrown at a goal my team needed to achieve within 6 months.

      Here are things I can share with you about my experience (I hope it's helpful):
      1. I'm still not an Android expert, in fact, far from it.
      2. Studying is never enough, hands-on experimentation and building apps on your own is the best way to learn. Also working with other engineers and learning from them is very important.
      3. There are layers even on mobile development, I rarely had to interact or write UI/frontend code. Most of my work was still mobile infra.
      4. Most important in my opinion, knowing my strengths and making sure I use them. I thought I was throwing away my experience, but that turned out not to be true. I feel we tend to evaluate software engineers as "coding machines", but there are other skills that are vital that we use everyday, things that don't go away by switching technologies or coding languages. For example, debugging complex systems/apps, problem solving, finding high impact opportunities, leading people, product or backend/server understanding... etc. All these are great skills that we should use. That's what helped me be more useful and able to compete with other engineers that could easily write triple the lines of code I write every day.

      My advice, I always believed in doing things we like to do and trying new things. If Android is what you are passionate about, I'd recommend giving it a try. Worst case scenario is that you learn a new field/technology, but you don't like it or you don't find work there, so you'd go back to what you do today (which you said yourself you're good at, so shouldn't be that hard to go back) and you'd still have learned something new.
