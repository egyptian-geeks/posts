  I use JSON as a database source in an IONIC App but DB is over 3MB and the app is quite slow any suggestions ?

  *I tried SQLite with its plugin but I couldn't operate that big database it only worked on a small one

      If ur app is slow, i don't see how db relates to that!
      If your data lies in the app memory and u have paging in your app, then the size of data won't matter!

    message: If JSON is your DB source it will only be efficient in certain retrieval
      scenarios, but those that require cross referencing of data will be slow naturally.
