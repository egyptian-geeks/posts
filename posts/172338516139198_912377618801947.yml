      Mohamed Samir If you checked the example published at the draft, you will find that the source of the HTML is independent from how the layout look. I assume this would require a lot of heavy calculations and this is why people might misuse it.
      Regarding the tables, back in the 90s till mid 2000, CSS wasn't mature enough to be used to create layouts. CSS floats were not fully understood and people were using tables to create layouts taking the advantage of the "border=0" attribute. People who created websites back in the early 2000s knows that horror :D People started using CSS layouts after Jeffrey Zeldman wrote his famous book "Designing with web standards", after that everything changed.
