  For the people inside Egypt
  I'm frustrated with all of the VPN service providers
  It's always unstable or not working at all
  I tried a lot of companie
  I need to know based on YOUR OWN experience which one works with you the best
  I know that VPN here is somehow being throttled or being screwed with, so that's why I'm asking for your own personal experience
  I tried:

  1. FrootVPN
  2. CactusVPN
  3. PrivateInternetAccess
  4. AirVPN

  So a little help please ?

      buy your own VPS and create a VPN server

      it allows you to use netflix aswell even after the new proxy detection ;)

      Get a free linux server on Amazon EC2 and build your own VPN. Or at least use SSH tunnel if you want to access something specific. There is a great Firefox addon called FoxyProxy which allows you to configure custom proxies based on the hostname or ip address or any wildcard.

      Personally I setup an IPSEC VPN from my TPLink router to another Cisco firewall in the US. I "assume" you could have a software IPsec in linux and set that up on Amazon.
