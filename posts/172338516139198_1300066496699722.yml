  For the people inside Egypt
  I'm frustrated with all of the VPN service providers
  It's always unstable or not working at all
  I tried a lot of companie
  I need to know based on YOUR OWN experience which one works with you the best
  I know that VPN here is somehow being throttled or being screwed with, so that's why I'm asking for your own personal experience
  I tried:

  1. FrootVPN
  2. CactusVPN
  3. PrivateInternetAccess
  4. AirVPN

  So a little help please ?

      buy your own VPS and create a VPN server

      it allows you to use netflix aswell even after the new proxy detection ;)

      Get a free linux server on Amazon EC2 and build your own VPN. Or at least use SSH tunnel if you want to access something specific. There is a great Firefox addon called FoxyProxy which allows you to configure custom proxies based on the hostname or ip address or any wildcard.

      Personally I setup an IPSEC VPN from my TPLink router to another Cisco firewall in the US. I "assume" you could have a software IPsec in linux and set that up on Amazon.

      If it's just a browsing matter, then these two fit:
      ZenMate extension for Chrome Or Browsec, total experience with both 4 years at least, they are stable no ads and work with high speed

      Zenmate & Hide.me are the best till now with me. Try them for free before purchasing to make sure that it suits you 　
      - Zenmate gives you 7 Day's Free Trial.
      - Hide.me gives you 2 GB download ( if you used them in your first 10 minutes, your trial is completed ) and you can also save them for more than 7 days if you don't use it much 　
      - Zenmate gives you more regions in your free trial, France & Luxembourg is the best for you ( I tried all of them ).
      - Hide.me gives you Netherlands & Canada & Singapore only in your free 2 GB, Netherlands is the best for you.
      Hope you find this information useful for you, Good Luck ;)
