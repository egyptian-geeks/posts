    message: "there is a lot of misunderstanding in these post and comments ,  -ECMA
      script is the  standards of javascript and standard over all browser depends
      on ECMA script version \n- Chrome and safari uses webkit engine not webtoolkit
      and chrome uses V8 as javascript engine and safari uses SquirrelFish\nand opera
      uses KHTML engine  and Carakan as js engine , and IE uses Triednt Engine and
      use Chakra js engine in IE9 \nthe topic is really complex for implementing simple
      app just use a framework to handle it like JQuery Or Prototype"
