message: We are creating a POS and store management software customized for a shop.
  It should ultimately have a central server connecting between two branches. It should
  have all what you expect from a POS application (transactions, receipts, barcode..etc)
  plus stock management and generation of reports. How much should such product cost
  in Egypt?
