  For android developers who have apps on the market :
  How many percent "Current installs" should be / "Total installs" ?
  In my case it's 56% "2,788/4,980" by that my app is falling down or it's normal and how to increase engagement between the user and my app so he "the user" never uninstall it ?

      That's called application retention rate.
      Your retention rate is actually quite good, see for yourself.
