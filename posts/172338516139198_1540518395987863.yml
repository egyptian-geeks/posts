message: "Hey all, this was an interview problem.\nI failed to see the relationship
  between the two arrays. Can anyone solve it? \n\nWrite a function to transform array
  a to array b and print the elements of array b to the console.\nlet a = [2, 4, 6,
  8, 9, 15]\nlet b = ['4', '16', '64']"

      The second array is of chars and all elements are powers of 2
      I don't know what is the relationship between he two arrays and you should have asked the interviewer this question. Asking for clarification is part of solving the problem

      Each element in array b is 2 to the power of the corresponding element of array a, this the only relation I can see. For example
      b[3] = 2^a[3]
