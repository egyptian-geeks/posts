message: how websites like https://www.pexels.com/ have a good quality images with
  small size ? do they perform some kind of compression tools/algorithms ? and do
  anyone  know how to perform lossless comparison using PHP ?

      I think first, define "small size" and "good quality". Both these are relative/subjective words (ie: What is small to you might be large to others, what looks good to you might be poor quality to others).

      I took a look at the website and I don't think the images are actually small in size; they are of "normal"/median size with variance in their sizes which we should expect.

      > Do they use some kind of compression/tools/algorithms?
      In general, to become more efficient we should consider:
      1. Media format. For example jpeg/pjpeg vs webp vs png... etc. Mp4 vs gif... etc.
      2. Dimensions of content vs view size. It doesn't make sense to download a 4K media on a 640px view size. We would be wasting a ton of data that will not be used.
      3. Timing. Can we prefetch some of these assets? Should we?
      4. Caching. Best way to save bytes is by not downloading them at all!

      Otherwise, to view the images on your screen, everyone will probably use a standard image format when downloading to clients. Otherwise how would clients/standard browsers understand how to compress the media?
      For example, Dropbox created an image compression technique they called Lepton to save disk space when storing those images, but again the trick is, before viewing those on clients, they first decompress and convert back to regular jpeg format so that clients can reuse/view them.

      For regular images, jpeg or pjpeg is the most appropriate; it produces fairly small images. Unless your image contains transparency, then I'd consider webp as well. For animation, consider webp or mp4/videos.

      > Does anyone know how to perform lossless comparison using PHP?
      I'm not sure I understand what "lossless comparison" means. Can you explain what you meant more?
      Assuming you're talking about measuring image quality. This is actually extremely tricky. In general though, there is reference based comparisons (ie: comparing two images where one of them is considered the "original") and non-reference based. Non-reference based quality measurement is very tricky because of one simple reason, you don't know what the "original" image looks like, so what if the original image's quality was bad to begin with?
      If you're looking for quality measurement tools, maybe check out SSIM and PSNR. You should also be able to find tools/scripts online to measure them.

      Hope this helps!
