    message: "i think this version should be somehow better than the other \n- many
      people would try to use it \n-the browser is somehow related to bing search
      so free product advertisement and so on \n-so that i think they should investment

      better enough in anyway ) and we are not talking about revolutionary change
      there but better enough to stay 1 day before install another browser not the
      first thing to do after windows setup - for me i just need ui imrovement - performance
      enhancement -memoery managemet and not crash for open 15 tabs not more :D and
      implement features like any modern browser  in any way there a beta version
      in win 10 jan. build to try and there a light version to test only in win 8.1
      in modern.ie"
