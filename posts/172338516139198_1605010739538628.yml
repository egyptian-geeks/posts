message: "Hi guys,\nI am using cordova-plugin-fcm in an ionic project to send  push
  notifications.\nThe Notification is working fine on android platform, but when I
  added iOS platform I couldn't get any notification on my device.\n\nHere are the
  things I've done:\n1- I added GoogleService-Info.plist to my project and inside
  platforms in ios folder. \n\n2- Enabled notification from Xcode\n\n3- I also tried
  to send test notification from Firebase console and it worked.\n\n4- The back-end
  team fired the function that sends notification and I could receive the notification
  on my device.\n\nBut when I test the app and try the case where notification should
  be received, I never get it.\n\nI don't even know how to debug this issues. Any
  ideas?"

      I am not helping, but I am using this plugin and I am telling you that you may
      need to come to peace with how it works. I remember the GitHub issues helped
      but not so much."

      I am still struggling with the same issue and I am having hard time understanding what I see in Xcode console
      but I can see that the fcm plugin is connected, I can get the token and  recieve the notification sent from firebase but not the one sent from the app
      So I will try to make sure the priority parameter is set to High and I will try to test on other ios versios and devices.
      Thank you all for your propmt replies, I will share the progress here.
