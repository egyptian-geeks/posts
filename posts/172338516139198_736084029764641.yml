    message: Fatma EL-Sayed Out of curiosity, did you actually search and couldn't
      find something or that's the first effort you put into finding tutorials for
      your topic, by posting here?

      What exactly do you want? The post comes across as a very trivial request, is your problem more complex?
      Also, if you could share what search queries where you using that got you no where, that'd be great.

      Well, Facebook docs would be a great starting point and here are some turnkey solutions that might or might not cost money.

      The group leans more towards being technical, I suggest you start working on something and if you faced a problem, a lot of members would be more than happy to provide assistance.
