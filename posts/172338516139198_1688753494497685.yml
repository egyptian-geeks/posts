      Looks nice, thanks for sharing!
      I have a couple of comments though
      First of all, using any of the mentioned 4 types of Subjects is not suitable for this specific case (propagating shared states across the whole app), because a subject like any other observable can hit a terminal state (error), once that happens, the subject will no longer emit any state, this means your bus will stop working if an error happens during the execution of a subscription.
      The solution is: using RxRelays.
      Secondly, your bus's "subscribe" method is preventing you from all the goodies of RxJava, like how can I map an event that I'm subscribing to to another data type?, how can I filter an event?, how can I handle the errors that might happen?
      The solution is: don't take the subscription function as a parameter, make the subscribe method return subject.asObservable() instead.
      One last major issue is that Singletons are an anti-pattern, having a shared state across the whole app can lead to a messy codebase (you won't know which event goes where, everyone is subscribing and emitting from the same place)
      You can find an improved implementation of the idea in here:
