      Business Designer at simpleia, UX consultancy :)

      Sometimes I do UX only (user research, information architecture, and wireframes).. I never do UI/visual designs or coding.

      At simpleia, UX and UI are two different things done by two different people.

    message: UX/UI and front-end are now all combined in one term called Product Designer
      and it's being used in many companies like Facebook and stripe. Also I beleive
      that the best one to do the UI is the one who did the UX. it doesn't have to
      be one person but it can be a team and all of them are involced in the process

      I'm webkeyz CEO, a Product & UX design agency. I've been doing design for 18 years, I've  done UX, IxD, UI and Product. Although these specializations intersect, yet they are different endeavors. Those who can do the UX (full throttle) and then UI I call them unicorns, and they are very rare to find (here and in Silicon Valley as well, we do have another office there).
      I retain a high resistance to the UX/UI coined term as it's been abused by UI designers to add glitters and sparkles to their titles/resumes.
      We apply a modified lean UX process at webkeyz, we have different teams for each speciality. I do believe the separation is in the favour of the product as each designer can focus more on what they are doing, ex: UX can focus on research, grids, navigation, validation, patterns, etc... While UI can focus on creative concept, color palette, typography, iconography, etc... Different mind sets for different jobs.
