  What is the best hosting service satisfying the following:
  - Big storage
  - Reseller Account
  - SSH
  - Excellent support

  We tried bluehost, hostgator, and hostmonster but there were many problems with them regarding the poor support. Also bluehost doesn't support reseller account and the server goes down a lot for maintenance (may last to more than 1 hour without prior notice)

  We also tried mediatemple which has a good support but expensive and has low limit for storage and bandwidth.

  What do you think given your experience?

    message: Can you define some numbers? Big storage for example is very subjective,
      you could mean 500GB or 2TB, also you can always get a VPS and connect it to
      S3 and you'll have instant "Big storage" so you're usage also should be specified
      as storing images is different than data that are processes over time.
