    message: I liked your answer and appreciate your proposals for a  solution for
      preventing re-post after browser F. My problem is that that fix requires changes
      in the whole application, the approach  I took is a lot simpler in the time
      being. The point is that I have to do it manually in each page load to cleat
      the submit click event and what I'm looking for is something similar to jquery's
      e.stop.Propagation() but is seems hard to implement in asp.net :(

      to the same URL in the check

    message: The point is there are some pages that have multiple post backs to show
      and hide things, bind grid,... with redirect I have to pass some switches on
      the query string which costs some efforts
