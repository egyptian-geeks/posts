      The sad part is that it has been on high priority since September 2015 :(
      It does support the old grid standard though, anybody know if the standards are compatible in any way? (is there a way to use a ployfill or something to generate different CSS with identical results?)

      Edge is the only browser? Edge WAS The only browser until earlier this month Firefox 52 was shipped with native support for CSS grid then followed by Chrome.

      The only problem with Edge now is that it support the older version of the specs
