  How to write a proper Software developer/engineer C.V?
  I have read many articles and templates regarding this topic till I reached to the current format for my C.V which can be found here
  I would like to hear you opinion about the C.V Format and information, and also help others to write their own C.V

      impressive Farouk Sabry, i will give you two advices:
      - Think about what to exclude from the CV, less is more, if you write a technology and the interviewer asks you a question about it and you tell him i haven't used it in 5 years it makes you look bad.
      - Customize your CV for each job category (or even for each job if possible). for example, if you are applying for a frontend position make the frontend section stand out, bring it to top add more details, highlight with fonts. still include something about backend but with less focus.

      good luck

      Well organized (Y)
      I think you should move the certifications part to the top of the list or place it under the "JAVA Software Engineer" title on the top, to grab the attention of the reader as a lot of companies care about this part more than anything else.

    message: "On top of the above, I believe you need you to reduce the skills section
      significantly. Focus on what matters for your career. i.e. as Software Engineer.
      So\n- It doesn't matter to write that you know XHTML & HTML5 (I don't even think
      it matters to write that you know HTML if you wrote that you know jquery for
      example\n- XML (or all its related technologies, believe me no one is expecting
      someone who doesn't know what XML is)\n- Waterfall \n- IDEs \n- Web Servers\n-
      Issue Tracker\n- CVS / SVN. (If you wrote you know git, that's enough)\n- Atom,
      MySQL workbench, PhpMyAdmin, Trello (They might ask in the interview what's
      your fav. IDE, but believe me no one will select you for a job cause you know
      Atom or use Eclipse)\n- in OS(you used Platform which I don't find really accurate):
      Just put Linux (which level, power user, strongly experienced ..etc) and  Windows.
      No need to write Windows xp, 7 & 10 (unless you're a sysadmin who will be chosen
      for being strongly familiar with all Windows editions)\n- Soft Skills, I find
      that personally no longer needed or viable simply cause someone won't reject
      you cause you didn't write you a fast learner, and also no one will choose you
      cause you wrote you are.\n\nOverall you did a good job in summarizing your CV
      and again this is just my opinion"

    message: '"Reduce the skills section significantly".... that really depends on
      who is reading your resume, a machine or a human? And if human, technical or
      recruiter looking for matching keywords. Some software (or may be many) parses
      and indexes resumes then sort them with the number of matching keywords. This
      makes a difference when there are hundreds of applicants, so the less keywords
      in your resume the lower your resume is rated - if it even appears. If a human
      and non-technical, that''s really tricky. My manager somehow liked my performance
      and another colleague whose name happened to be Ahmed as well - a very rare
      coincident, he sent our resumes to the recruiter asking him to find people of
      similar profiles. Guess what? He brought him a candidate named Ahmed, haha.
      That might be okay in Cairo where there so many Ahmed, but it''s not very common
      to find software engineers called Ahmed in Toronto with profiles similar to
      ours. Unfortunately he didn''t have the needed skills and didn''t even get a
      phone screening interview! A technical human who would understand that SVN and
      Git are similar and he has enough time to do a first scan of resumes. That''s
      usually an Engineer busy with other tasks. My guess it''s a low probability
      but may still work out for some. I would suggest you keep all the keywords but
      if you don''t like them from a formatting perspective, you may want to push
      them to the bottom under Detailed Skills or Keywords section and have a summary
      at the top. In such a case and in the summary, I may choose to write version
      control systems instead of SVN or Git. These are always personal preferences
      and different resumes format reflect our different experiences after all - or
      so they should. All the best and great work!!!'

    message: I see no use for the objectives section. This should be the role of a
      cover letter which is customized based on the job. Even the current objective
      of starting your own company might result in some recruiters excluding your
      CV because it gives the feeling that you are joining for a temporary period
      only. Good luck!
