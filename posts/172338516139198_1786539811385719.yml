message: "Hello everyone, \nI want to make use of the sale on Udemy (all courses for
  only $11).\nI'm still a beginner and I want to learn Python. After I searched the
  site, I think this course is one of the best: \nhttps://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/\n\nSo,
  I want your recommendations.. \nIs anyone familiar with this course? \nDo you think
  there are better resources to learn Python?\n\nAnd finally, how often does Udemy
  make such sales? Can I expect to have a similar opportunity soon if I missed this
  one?\n\nI hope to get some answers today because the sale ends tomorrow.\n\nThanks."

    message: "If you're just getting started then I should recommend Automate the
      boring stuff w/ python again and again. \nIt's a book and a course. The book
      is available free on their website, Part of the  course is paid but you can
      find most of it available officially on YouTube."
