message: "Hey guys,\nAbout three weeks ago I asked about some book about cryptography
  which is shown in the picture below and I just want to say my opinion about it for
  anyone who's interested in this book the same as I did. It is really a rescue for
  me from relatively complicated references. Also, I can recommend other books in
  and cryptography focusing on it's mathematic rather than the the techniques. Anyways
  it's just a matter of choice for you so if you are just interested in the cryptography
  principles from a  technical view you can just go for this book but if you are interested
  in a detailed academic cryptography mathematics you can go for \n\U0001F4DA\"Discrete
  math for computer science students\"\U0001F4DA\nThe authors are Ken Bogart and Scott
  Drysdale and a Cliff Stein\nAs I said, the first one is more into technical issues
  and more real world implementations of cryptography schemes and it's in my humble
  opinion better for you to go for that book in case if you are interested in topics
  like information security as it will give you more information about cryptography
  as a technical matter. \nThe second book mentioned in the post doesn't not cover
  alot of cryptography issues as much as covering mathematics behid them (just RSA)
  but it explains the math for complete beginners in cryptography math namely discrete
  mathematics and number theory."
