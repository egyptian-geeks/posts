  "So people have been blaming Microsoft for this, there's a lot of blame to go around, Microsoft shares some of the blame, but, in some ways,
  what's happening is we're all driving around in 1940s Fords,
  and then when we have an accident we're complaining that the airbag didn't go off!
  Well, there isn't an airbag in those 1940s Fords, that's why, right? So unless you take it to the garage and have one installed, you know?

  It's that kind of principle.
  So yes, Microsoft wrote an operating system with a bug in, right? All operating systems have bugs in, all software have bugs in. They patched it quickly, they found it and patched it in March
  and they've aggressively put out patches for legacy operating systems to try and combat it.
  So they've at least taken all the steps they can to solve this."

    message: This isn't just a bug , it's leaked vulurnability from last Nsa attack
      , it's a backdoor not just a bug (personal opinion) we aren't safe yet , as
      the tools leaked still featured more bad surprises we don't know anything about
      them ,it is like having a remote controlled bomb inside your car.
