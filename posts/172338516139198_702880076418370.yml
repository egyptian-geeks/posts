      in the icon itself ? that would be great, also the option to store to desktop
      instead of web will be great.

    message: Yes for app development the design is irrelevant (don't tell anybody
      it's a secret) just focus on the actual functionality of the App it self. people
      don't care if your site is horrible, broken or anything. they only care that
      the app they downloaded work.

    message: Cool stuff man, best of luck. Regarding objc, I was actually referring
      to the project itself :D was just wondering about the stack you guys are using.
      Specifically  for the desktop app, but any info about the server stack wont
      harm either :D

    message: yeah for the desktop it's Objective C and Socket.io :)  and for the web
      stack we have made our own stack of libraries for development, testing and errors
      reporting all based on  javascript client side and server side :)
