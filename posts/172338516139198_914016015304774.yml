  Hey there,
  I'm a 17-year-old Egyptian. I'll finish high school in 4 months.
  I love all kinds of technology.
  I've already started learning Front-End Web Development online..Finished HTML/CSS courses and about to finish a Javascript course..
  I've little experience with Graphic Design (Mainly Photoshop) and I know I'll have to get better at it to be a better Web Designer.
  But I can't really decide which field to choose as my main skill or career.
  The main fields I have in mind are: Web Development (Full-stack), Graphic Design (Logos, Branding, and things like that), Android Development, and Motion Graphics (2D).
  So..What the hell should I do? :D
  Thank you!

      Hassan has a good point, I'm registered in an Engineering School to have the exemption, I'm stuck that I can't officially drop out and I have to pay 10K every year. So I regret joining a private institute since then.

      So join an easy governmental institute, finish it (when you decide it's the right time), and meanwhile gain experience in the field.

      First, I am glad you're doing that from now, you will never be a good in anything but those you loved. I believe you already love coding and design things. actually you can work in both, the web-design field has this areas, yes you can be specialized in any of them, but there is also a chance to master pieces from both .
      But please note that .
      Everything is possible in-developing by learning, but this is not applied in design !, yes you can learn 75% of design tools and skills, but there are 25% talent you cannot learn by watching or in the books, this is the only different i think, so if you do not think you have a design talent, so development will be good for you, if you think you have a talent, design will be the choice, if you still hesitated I think you walk in both until the life itself will decide for you :D .
