  Anybody here ran his/her own mail server before? I manage a few hosting accounts for friends and recently I moved from managed VPS to digitalocean ... Everything is running perfectly except for emails ...
  I did a lot of research ... The options I found was either:
  1- Use a third party service like https://www.mailcheap.co/ ... Seems to fit exactly what I need but it's expensive ($24/mo)
  2- Run my own mail server using Mail-In-A-Box on digitalocean. It will cost nearly $120/yr but I read a lot of articles and discussions on reddit and hosting forums discouraging running your own server. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server.
  3- Use a free service like Zoho mail but it is limited to one domain per account and 10 email addresses per account. I can create multiple accounts but I don't want to do that.

  I would like to get your input if you have any experience.

    message: "I used postfix and roundcube webmail before. It took hours to configure
      it correctly with MySQL database, but at the end it works. \nYou will fight
      it for hours, but then it will work. You'll need to watch for disk space of
      course. \nAlso, you will need some extra configuration to whitelist your mail
      server from spamming lists. I used 6sync hosting at the time, but Linode should
      work just fine as well. I think AWS too, but most of their IP ranges for EC2
      are blacklisted mail senders most of the time :-D"

    message: "I have ran email servers/services for several yeara. If you can afford
      it, don't run your own email system. \n\nEmail is a pretty complex system that
      requires a lot of experience to get things right. It involves a lot of technologies,
      services, people and just too much moving parts to control easily. \n\nYou can
      do everything right and just land with an IP with bad reputation on DO and have
      a shitty delivery rate despite all your work. One of your clients could has
      his computer owned and you end up with millions of spam emails in your queue
      and fully broken service. \n\nThat being said, it's an excellent learning opportunity!
      You will learn a lot! Just try to start with a small system with a very small
      number of users. Supporting users is a massive pain and it's why all those providers
      are pretty expensive. \n\nStart small, read a lot and don't make a lot of mistakes
      to avoid reputation penalties. You can route your outgoing email through services
      like sendgrid and mandrill in the beginning to avoid losing email. That's very
      simple to implement, and will give you excellent view of your delivery rate."

      The most professional option and cheapest as well is Amazon SES, but it's a bare bone service which only gives you API and requires experience to run.
      If you want SMTP, you have Mailgun from rack space, then mail chimp/mandrill

      If you want a mail inbox that users can send/receive emails from then you have a few options:

      1. Amazon Workmail, which will cost you $4 per user per month: https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/

      2. Rackspace email, which may cost you around $2 per user per month: https://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/webmail

      3. If you are looking for a shared hosting, Dreamhost is a great hosting that gives you unlimited free email inboxes for the domains they host for you included in their hosting plan. I have used them for so long, and their emails are reliable: http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1017456

      4. Of course you have checked Google Apps. They will cost around $5 per user per month.
