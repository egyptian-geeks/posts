message: "Hi all,\n\nI have a moderately-sized code base for a software that controls
  an imaging system in my lab (some hardware control for scanning and acquisition,
  and then some processing, file I/O, and display). It works. There are some bugs,
  but we learned our way around them. I had to tweak it a bit to be able to acquire
  at full speed (~ 4 GB/s), so we stream to RAM first, and copy to disk after an acquisition
  session is done.  \n\nThe software is not user-friendly, and the code (written entirely
  in C++ and windows forms) is nowhere near beginner-friendly. \n\nNow, I wanted to
  address those two issues. I'm considering two approaches here:\n1- Rewrite in C#,
  reverting to C or C++ in whatever parts that might need the extra speedup.\n2- Refactor
  the C++ code, with the caveat that some things will need to be completely redesigned
  (such as how the different forms are generated). \n\nWhich would you recommend and
  why?"

    message: My Suggestion, i'd rewrite GUI in C# WPF/WinForms because GUIs in C++
      is a hell. And leave the Core in C++ and use it as a library.

      For me Option 2 is more secure for the core.
      How much frequent do you need to update that code base ?
      if it's very frequent try to do some analysis from your source-control history to be able to determine the bottleneck parts.
      maybe only certain parts or files that need to be refactored.
      If you are updating the UI a lot try to separate the core from the UI to be able to migrate to more GUI friendly environment.

    message: Qt needs one or two days to learn the basics. Qt MVC is very powerful
      and u can very easily integrate the UI with ur code base.

      2 any gui framework can make your life much easier.
      You even can make the gui layer in web warper that calls c++ code.

      Option 2 with C# WinForms
      1- Organize your C++ code
      2- Add a Managed C++ layer in the middle to wrap the C++ library and expose a Managed Class to the C# code
      3- Write WindowsForms in C# and call the Managed Class
