    message: I have tried many many times. But I don't know how to do the accurate
      calculations as the mechanism of creating and storing files at certain size
      is wierd enough :(

      if the indentation uses Tabs, every tab is of one chararcter size ( a byte), if the editor uses spaces ( 4 or 8 ) every space is considered a character ( 4 = 4 bytes ).

      modern editors indent using spaces, I believe.

      so, what do you mean by "mechanism of creating and storing files" ? and what "calculations" do you have to do ?

      I am thinking of a new way for reducing the code file size and still being readable with indentations ...

      Some statistics...
      Using windows notepad text editor :
      tab= 2byte
      new line = 3byte
      space = 2byte

      Using windows notepad++ text editor :
      tab= 1byte
      new line = 1byte
      space= 1byte

      ------------------------------------------------------------
      ""It depends what is the character and what encoding it is in:

      An ASCII character in 8-bit ASCII encoding is 8 bits (1 byte), though it can fit in 7 bits.

      An ISO-8895-1 character in ISO-8859-1 encoding is 8 bits (1 byte).

      A Unicode character in UTF-8 encoding is between 8 bits (1 byte) and 32 bits (4 bytes).

      A Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding is between 16 (2 bytes) and 32 bits (4 bytes), though most of the common characters take 16 bits. This is the encoding used by Windows internally.

      A Unicode character in UTF-32 encoding is always 32 bits (4 bytes).

      An ASCII character in UTF-8 is 8 bits (1 byte), and in UTF-16 - 16 bits.

      The additional (non-ASCII) characters in ISO-8895-1 (0xA0-0xFF) would take 16 bits in UTF-8 and UTF-16.
