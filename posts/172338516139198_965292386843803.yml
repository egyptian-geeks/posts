    message: There is no mechanism. Normal source files aren't compressed and compiled
      files obviously retain no indentation. If you want to see how much difference
      indentation makes, compare same source file's size after running AStyle/Beautifier/Tidy/Whatever
      and after removing all spaces and tabs.

    message: I have tried many many times. But I don't know how to do the accurate
      calculations as the mechanism of creating and storing files at certain size
      is wierd enough :(

    message: I find this hard to believe. Most editors show a byte count in the bottom
      bar. In Windows you can right click any file and look at the size entry.

      if the indentation uses Tabs, every tab is of one chararcter size ( a byte), if the editor uses spaces ( 4 or 8 ) every space is considered a character ( 4 = 4 bytes ).

      modern editors indent using spaces, I believe.

      so, what do you mean by "mechanism of creating and storing files" ? and what "calculations" do you have to do ?

      I am thinking of a new way for reducing the code file size and still being readable with indentations ...

      Some statistics...
      Using windows notepad text editor :
      tab= 2byte
      new line = 3byte
      space = 2byte

      Using windows notepad++ text editor :
      tab= 1byte
      new line = 1byte
      space= 1byte

      ------------------------------------------------------------
      ""It depends what is the character and what encoding it is in:

      An ASCII character in 8-bit ASCII encoding is 8 bits (1 byte), though it can fit in 7 bits.

      An ISO-8895-1 character in ISO-8859-1 encoding is 8 bits (1 byte).

      A Unicode character in UTF-8 encoding is between 8 bits (1 byte) and 32 bits (4 bytes).

      A Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding is between 16 (2 bytes) and 32 bits (4 bytes), though most of the common characters take 16 bits. This is the encoding used by Windows internally.

      A Unicode character in UTF-32 encoding is always 32 bits (4 bytes).

      An ASCII character in UTF-8 is 8 bits (1 byte), and in UTF-16 - 16 bits.

      The additional (non-ASCII) characters in ISO-8895-1 (0xA0-0xFF) would take 16 bits in UTF-8 and UTF-16.
