message: "Hi guys,\n\nI've an EC2 instance (ubuntu based) with a root volume.\n\n1-
  I've created a snapshot of the root volume. \n2- Then created a new volume from
  the snapshot. \n3- Then created a new empty volume and formatted it as ext4 file
  system. \n4- Then copied all the files from the snap volume to the new empty volume
  via \"sudo rsync -aHAXxSP\". \n5- Then attached the new volume as root volume \"/dev/sda1\".
  \n\nThe problem was that the instance is getting \"initialising\" state then turing
  to \"stop\" state. anyone have any clue?"
