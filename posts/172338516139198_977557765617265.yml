      as far as I know, WPF already has great support for touch, almost all controls have events for touch (as well as mouse and stylus), so I don't think you'll need any 3rd-party libraries.

      Edit: also consider making a universal windows app (aka metro/modern), the XAML and code are very similar and the platform is designed to work great with touch.
