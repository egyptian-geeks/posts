  For the network geeks out there, I get internet in my house via some mysterious wireless device on my roof that connects to an internet provider about 3 Kms away.

  Anyway, those people are seriously incompetent, and I never run out of internet problems on a daily basis. The latest issues is randomly getting 404 errors. The issue is completely random, not related to a certain site or a certain time.

  I tried changing my DNS server to 8.8.8.8 to no effect. The issue only goes away when I use an SSH tunnel to a USA server, which of course is too slow for daily usage.

  I appreciate any help on this matter, since my incompetent ISP do not even know where to start looking.

      Was that "MTU Size"?

      It was set to a default value of 1500, a bit of online research showed that LinkDSL (which is the provider behind my ISP) uses a value of 1492. I tried that and will see what happens.
