      People who keep telling and comparing between Angular & jQuery can't get that they are 2 completely different products serving 2 different purposes. :)
      the short answer: use angular to build solutions and sophisticated (or simple, it's your choice) MVC JS apps using the built-in toolset, which is why angular is usually categorized as a javascript MVC framework (not a library like jQuery). :)

      and write a unified JS code, which is guaranteed to be consistent regardless
      of the used browser.'
