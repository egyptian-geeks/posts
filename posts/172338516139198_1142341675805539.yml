    message: I think it's easier to be admitted as an undergraduate that a postgraduate
      aside of you needing a toefl or a gre. It will really help if you are already
      at an international highschool and finally extracurricular activities and experience
      will definitely help.One last thing, if you're self funded consider all top
      ranked in both USA and UK MIT is amazing but not the end of the world.
