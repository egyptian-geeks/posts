    message: I use my raspberry pi as a NAS controller, hooking it to a 1 Tera external
      hard disk, use debian on the Pi to share the drive using samba. and since this
      is debian so you will find packages to do the features you want. Although this
      setup is very tempting, I do not recommend it because it has low transfer rates
      from and to the NAS. It is OK if you want to use it for small files, but if
      you are planning to move large files (movies or so), it will be slow
